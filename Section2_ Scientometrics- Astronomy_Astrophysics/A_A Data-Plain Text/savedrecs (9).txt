AB We consider the standard model with local scale invariance. The theory shows exact scale invariance of dimensionally regulated action. We show that massless gauge fields, which may be Abelian or non-Abelian, lead to vanishing contribution to the cosmological constant in this theory. This result follows in the quantum theory, to all orders in the gauge couplings. However, we have not considered contributions higher orders in the gravitational coupling. Similarly we also find that massless fermion fields yield null contribution to the cosmological constant. The effective cosmological constant in this theory is nonzero due to the phenomenon of cosmological symmetry breaking, which also gives masses to all the massive fields, besides generating the Planck mass. We find a simple relationship between the curvature scalar and the vacuum value of the Higgs field in the limit when we ignore all other contributions to the energy density besides the vacuum energy.

AB We present BVI CCD photometry of 10 northern open clusters, Berkeley 43, Berkeley 45, Berkeley 47, NGC 6846, Berkeley 49, Berkeley 51, Berkeley 89, Berkeley 91, Tombaugh 4 and Berkeley 9, and estimate their fundamental parameters. Eight of the clusters are located in the first Galactic quadrant and two are in the second. This is the first optical photometry for eight clusters. All of them are embedded in rich Galactic fields and have large reddening towards them [E(B - V) = 1.0-2.3 mag]. There is a possibility that some of these difficult-to-study clusters may be asterisms rather than physical systems, but assuming that they are physical clusters, we find that eight of them are located beyond 2 kpc and six clusters (60 per cent of the sample) are located well above or below the Galactic plane. Seven clusters have ages 500 Myr or less and the other three are 1 Gyr or more in age. This sample of clusters has increased the optical photometry of clusters in the second half of the first Galactic quadrant, beyond 2 kpc, from 10 to 15. NGC 6846 is found to be one of the most distant clusters in this region of the Galaxy.

AB We present a detailed analysis of the H-2 and HD absorption lines detected in the damped Lyman alpha (DLA) system at z(abs) = 2.3377 towards the quasar Q 1232 + 082. We show that this intervening cloud has a covering factor smaller than unity and covers only part of the quasi-stellar object (QSO) broad emission-line region. The zero flux level has to be corrected at the position of the saturated H-2 and optically thin HD lines by about 10 per cent. We accurately determine the Doppler parameter for HD and C i lines (b = 1.86 +/- 0.20 km s-1). We find a ratio N(HD)/N(H-2) = (7.1+3.7(-2.2)) x 10-5 that is significantly higher than what is observed in molecular clouds of the Galaxy. Chemical models suggest that in the physical conditions prevailing in the central part of molecular clouds, deuterium and hydrogen are mostly in their molecular forms. Assuming this is true, we derive D/H = (3.6+1.9(-1.1)) x 10-5. This implies that the corresponding baryon density of the Universe is (b) h2 = 0.0182+0.0047(-0.0042). This value coincides within 1 Sigma with that derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) as well as from observations of the D/H atomic ratio in low-metallicity QSO absorption-line systems. The observation of HD at high redshift is therefore a promising independent method to constrain (b). This observation indicates as well a low astration factor of deuterium. This can be interpreted as the consequence of an intense infall of primordial gas on to the associated galaxy.

AB We study the stability of supersymmetry breaking metastable vacua and supersymmetric vacua in the presence of solitons. The metastable vacua of supersymmetric QCD and those found elsewhere such as in models based on the SU(5) grand unified group support the existence of topological solitons. The vacua containing such topological defects can become unstable against decay into lower energy configurations. We show for a specific model that a finite region of the available parameter space of couplings becomes disallowed due to the presence of monopoles. In a manner similar to previous studies based on cosmic strings, it is shown that soliton solutions arising in supersymmetric theories can put constraints on the range of allowed values of the couplings arising in the theories. Implications for cosmology are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Previous observations of the middle-aged pulsar Geminga with XMM-Newton and Chandra have shown an unusual pulsar wind nebula (PWN), with a 20 '' long central (axial) tail directed opposite to the pulsar's proper motion and two 2' long, bent lateral (outer) tails. Here, we report on a deeper Chandra observation (78 ks exposure) and a few additional XMM-Newton observations of the Geminga PWN. The new Chandra observation has shown that the axial tail, which includes up to three brighter blobs, extends at least 50 '' (i.e., 0.06d(250) pc) from the pulsar (d(250) is the distance scaled to 250 pc). It also allowed us to image the patchy outer tails and the emission in the immediate vicinity of the pulsar with high resolution. The PWN luminosity, L(0.3-8 keV) similar to 3 x 10(29)d(250)(2) erg s(-1), is lower than the pulsar's magnetospheric luminosity by a factor of 10. The spectra of the PWN elements are rather hard (photon index Gamma similar to 1). Comparing the two Chandra images, we found evidence of PWN variability, including possible motion of the blobs along the axial tail. The X-ray PWN is the synchrotron radiation from relativistic particles of the pulsar wind (PW); its morphology is connected with the supersonic motion of Geminga. We speculate that the outer tails are either a sky projection of the limb-brightened boundary of a shell formed in the region of contact discontinuity, where the wind bulk flow is decelerated by shear instability, or polar outflows from the pulsar bent by the ram pressure from the interstellar medium. In the former case, the axial tail may be a jet emanating along the pulsar's spin axis, perhaps aligned with the direction of motion. In the latter case, the axial tail may be the shocked PW collimated by ram pressure.

AB Using multi-wavelength observations of SOHO/MDI, SOT-Hinode/blue-continuum (4504 angstrom), G band (4305 angstrom), Ca II H (3968 angstrom), and TRACE 171 angstrom, we present the observational signature of a highly twisted magnetic loop in AR 10960 during the period 04:43 UT-04:52 UT on 2007 June 4. SOT-Hinode/blue-continuum (4504 angstrom) observations show that penumbral filaments of positive polarity sunspot have counterclockwise twist, which may be caused by the clockwise rotation of the spot umbrae. The coronal loop, whose one footpoint is anchored in this sunspot, shows strong right-handed twist in chromospheric SOT-Hinode/Ca II H (3968 angstrom) and coronal TRACE 171 angstrom images. The length and the radius of the loop are L similar to 80 Mm and a similar to 4.0 Mm, respectively. The distance between neighboring turns of magnetic field lines (i.e., pitch) is estimated as approximate to 10 Mm. The total twist angle, Phi similar to 12 pi (estimated for the homogeneous distribution of the twist along the loop), is much larger than the Kruskal-Shafranov instability criterion. We detected clear double structure of the loop top during 04:47 UT-04:51 UT on TRACE 171 angstrom images, which is consistent with simulated kink instability in curved coronal loops. We suggest that the kink instability of this twisted magnetic loop triggered a B5.0 class solar flare, which occurred between 04:40 UT and 04:51 UT in this active region.

AB The microstructure of rain has been studied with observations using a vertical looking Micro Rain Radar (MRR) at Ahmedabad (23.06 degrees N, 72.62 degrees E), a tropical location in the Indian region. The rain height, derived from the bright band signature of melting layer of radar reflectivity profile, is found to be variable between the heights 4600 m and 5200 m. The change in the nature of rain, classified on the basis of radar reflectivity, is also observed through the MRR. It has been found that there are three types of rain, namely, convective, mixed and stratiform rain, prevailing with different vertical rain microstructures, such as, Drop Size Distribution (DSD), mean drop size, rain rate, liquid water content and average fall speed of the drops at different heights. It is observed that the vertical DSD profile is more inhomogeneous for mixed and stratiform type rain than for convective type rain. It is also found that the large number of drops of size <0.5 mm is present in convective rain whereas in stratiform rain, drops concentration is appreciable up to 1 mm. A comparison of measurements taken by ground based Disdrometer and that from the 200 m level obtained from MRR shows good agreement for rain rate and DSD at smaller rain rate values. The results may be useful for understanding rain structures over this region. (C) 2010 COSPA R. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB We present results from an all-sky search for unmodeled gravitational-wave bursts in the data collected by the LIGO, GEO 600 and Virgo detectors between November 2006 and October 2007. The search is performed by three different analysis algorithms over the frequency band 50-6000 Hz. Data are analyzed for times with at least two of the four LIGO-Virgo detectors in coincident operation, with a total live time of 266 days. No events produced by the search algorithms survive the selection cuts. We set a frequentist upper limit on the rate of gravitational-wave bursts impinging on our network of detectors. When combined with the previous LIGO search of the data collected between November 2005 and November 2006, the upper limit on the rate of detectable gravitational-wave bursts in the 64-2048 Hz band is 2.0 events per year at 90% confidence. We also present event rate versus strength exclusion plots for several types of plausible burst waveforms. The sensitivity of the combined search is expressed in terms of the root-sum-squared strain amplitude for a variety of simulated waveforms and lies in the range 6 x 10(-22) Hz(-1/2) to 2 x 10(-20) Hz(-1/2). This is the first untriggered burst search to use data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors together, and the most sensitive untriggered burst search performed so far.

AB In this paper, we carry out a study of viable cosmological models in f(R) gravity at the background level. We use observable parameters like Omega and gamma to form an autonomous system of equations and show that the models under consideration exhibit two different regimes in their time evolution, namely, a phantom phase followed by a quintessencelike behavior. We employ state finder parameters to emphasize a characteristic discriminative signature of these models.

ID DIMENSIONAL SCHWARZSCHILD SPACETIME; BLACK-HOLES
AB In Newtonian theory, gravity inside a constant density static sphere is independent of spacetime dimension. Interestingly this general result is also carried over to Einsteinian as well as higher order Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (Lovelock) gravity notwithstanding their nonlinearity. We prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for universality of the Schwarzschild interior solution describing a uniform density sphere for all n greater than or similar to 4 is that its density is constant.

TI Reheating the D-brane universe via instant preheating
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID PROBE WMAP OBSERVATIONS; QUINTESSENTIAL INFLATION; COSMOLOGY
AB We investigate a possibility of reheating in a scenario of D-brane inflation in a warped deformed conifold background which includes perturbative corrections to throat geometry sourced by a chiral operator of dimension 3/2 in the conformal field theory. The effective D-brane potential, in this case, belongs to the class of nonoscillatory models of inflation for which the conventional reheating mechanism does not work. We find that gravitational particle production is inefficient and leads to reheating temperature of the order of 10(8) GeV. We show that instant preheating is quite suitable to the present scenario and can easily reheat the universe to a temperature which is higher by about 3 orders of magnitude than its counterpart associated with gravitational particle production. The reheating temperature is shown to be insensitive to a particular choice of inflationary parameters suitable to observations.

   determining distance-redshift relation via gravitational radiation from

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID WAVE STANDARD SIRENS; DARK ENERGY; COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT; UNIVERSE
AB By observing mergers of compact objects, future gravity wave experiments would measure the luminosity distance to a large number of sources to a high precision but not their redshifts. Given the directional sensitivity of an experiment, a fraction of such sources (gold plated) can be identified optically as single objects in the direction of the source. We show that if an approximate distance-redshift relation is known then it is possible to statistically resolve those sources that have multiple galaxies in the beam. We study the feasibility of using gold plated sources to iteratively resolve the unresolved sources, obtain the self-calibrated best possible distance-redshift relation and provide an analytical expression for the accuracy achievable. We derive the lower limit on the total number of sources that is needed to achieve this accuracy through self-calibration. We show that this limit depends exponentially on the beam width and give estimates for various experimental parameters representative of future gravitational wave experiments DECIGO and BBO.

AB We derive a condition on the Lagrangian density describing a generic, single, noncanonical scalar field, by demanding that the intrinsic, nonadiabatic pressure perturbation associated with the scalar field vanishes identically. Based on the analogy with perfect fluids, we refer to such fields as perfect scalar fields. It is common knowledge that models that depend only on the kinetic energy of the scalar field (often referred to as pure kinetic models) possess no nonadiabatic pressure perturbation. While we are able to construct models that seemingly depend on the scalar field and also do not contain any nonadiabatic pressure perturbation, we find that all such models that we construct allow a redefinition of the field under which they reduce to pure kinetic models. We show that, if a perfect scalar field drives inflation, then, in such situations, the first slow roll parameter will always be a monotonically decreasing function of time. We point out that this behavior implies that these scalar fields cannot lead to features in the inflationary, scalar perturbation spectrum.

AB We present multiwavelength investigation of morphology, physical-environment, stellar contents, and star formation activity in the vicinity of star-forming region Sh 2-100. It is found that the Sh 2-100 region contains seven H II regions of ultracompact and compact nature. The present estimation of distance for three H II regions, along with the kinematic distance for others, suggests that all of them belong to the same molecular cloud complex. Using near-infrared photometry, we identified the most probable ionizing sources of six H II regions. Their approximate photometric spectral type estimates suggest that they are massive early-B to mid-O zero-age-main-sequence stars and agree well with radio continuum observations at 1280 MHz, for sources whose emissions are optically thin at this frequency. The morphology of the complex shows a non-uniform distribution of warm and hot dust, well mixed with the ionized gas, which correlates well with the variation of average visual extinction (similar to 4.2-97 mag) across the region. We estimated the physical parameters of ionized gas with the help of radio continuum observations. We detected an optically visible compact nebula located to the south of the 850 mu m emission associated with one of the H II regions and the diagnostic of the optical emission line ratios gives electron density and electron temperature of similar to 0.67 x 10(3) cm(-3) and similar to 10(4) K, respectively. The physical parameters suggest that all the H II regions are in different stages of evolution, which correlate well with the probable ages in the range similar to 0.01-2 Myr of the ionizing sources. The spatial distribution of infrared excess stars, selected from near-infrared and Infrared Array Camera color-color diagrams, correlates well with the association of gas and dust. The positions of infrared excess stars, ultracompact and compact H II regions at the periphery of an H I shell, possibly created by a WR star, indicate that star formation in Sh 2-100 region might have been induced by an expanding H I shell.

AB Solar sub-surface fluid topology provides an indirect approach to examine the internal characteristics of active regions (ARs). Earlier studies have revealed the prevalence of strong flows in the interior of ARs having complex magnetic fields. Using the Doppler data obtained by the Global Oscillation Network Group project for a sample of 74 ARs, we have discovered the presence of steep gradients in meridional velocity at depths ranging from 1.5 to 5Mm in flare productive ARs. The sample of these ARs is taken from the Carrington rotations 1980-2052 covering the period 2001 August-2007 January. The gradients showed an interesting hemispheric trend of negative (positive) signs in the northern (southern) hemisphere, i.e., directed toward the equator. We have discovered three sheared layers in the depth range of 0-10 Mm, providing evidence of complex flow structures in several ARs. An important inference derived from our analysis is that the location of the deepest zero vertical vorticity is correlated with the remaining lifetime of ARs. This new finding may be employed as a tool for predicting the life expectancy of an AR.

AB The presence of about a dozen short-lived nuclides in the early solar system, including Fe-60 and Al-26, has been established from isotopic studies of meteorite samples. An accurate estimation of solar system initial abundance of Fe-60, a distinct product of stellar nucleosynthesis, is important to infer the stellar source of this nuclide. Previous studies in this regard suffered from the lack of exact knowledge of the time of formation of the analyzed meteorite samples. We present here results obtained from the first combined study of Fe-60 and Al-26 records in early solar system objects to remove this ambiguity. Chondrules from unequilibrated ordinary chondrites belonging to low petrologic grades were analyzed for their Fe-Ni and Al-Mg isotope systematics. The Al-Mg isotope data provide the time of formation of the analyzed chondrules relative to the first solar system solids, the Ca-Al-rich inclusions. The inferred initial Fe-60/Fe-56 values of four chondrules, combined with their time of formation based on Al-Mg isotope data, yielded a weighted mean value of (6.3 +/- 2) x 10(-7) for solar system initial Fe-60/Fe-56. This argues for a high-mass supernova as the source of Fe-60 along with Al-26 and several other short-lived nuclides present in the early solar system.

AB It is possible to provide a physical interpretation for the field equations of gravity based on a thermodynamical perspective. The virtual degrees of freedom associated with the horizons, as perceived by the local Rindler observer, play a crucial role in this approach. In this context, the relation S = E/2T between the entropy (S), active gravitational mass (E) and temperature (T) - obtained previously in gr-qc/0308070 [CQG, 21, 4485 (2004)] - can be reinterpreted as the law of equipartition E = (1/2)nk(B)T where n = Delta A/L(P)(2) is the number (density) of microscopic horizon degrees of freedom in an area Delta A. Conversely, one can use the equipartition argument to provide a thermodynamic interpretation of gravity, even in the nonrelativistic limit. These results emphasize the intrinsic quantum nature of all gravitational phenomena and diminishes the distinction between thermal phenomena associated with local Rindler horizons and the usual thermodynamics of macroscopic bodies in non-inertial frames. Just like the original thermodynamic interpretation, these results also hold for a wide class of gravitational theories like the Lanczos-Lovelock models.

AB In the present paper investigations are made on the lower ionosphere with the help of observed tweek atmospherics at the Indian Antarctic research station Maitri during the second half of austral summer (January-March of 2003 and 2005). The variations in the lower ionospheric reflection height are found to be in correspondence with the sunrise and sunset at Maitri. The results indicate that the tweek atmospherics are helpful in tracking the changes taking place in the lower ionospheric height through the day-night boundary. The ionospheric reflection height estimated using the cutoff frequency of fundamental (first-harmonic or first-mode) tweek atmospherics ranges from similar to 64 to similar to 79 km with a maximum calculated error of +/-2.7 km. The recordings were carried out from 1800 to 0600 UTC. The analysis shows that the average cutoff frequency for the fundamental tweek atmospherics and hence the ionospheric reflection height varies from the months of January to March in accordance with the sunrise and sunset.

AB We have derived a new generalised uncertainty principle (GUP) based on certain general assumptions. This GUP is consistent with predictions from string theory. It is then used to study Schwarzschild black hole thermodynamics. Corrections to the mass-temperature relation, area law and heat capacity are obtained. We find that the evaporation process stops at a particular mass, referred as the remnant mass. This is instrumental in bypassing the well-known singularity problem that occurs in a semiclassical approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey (TAOS) project has collected more than a billion photometric measurements since 2005 January. These sky survey data-covering timescales from a fraction of a second to a few hundred days-are a useful source to study stellar variability. A total of 167 star fields, mostly along the ecliptic plane, have been selected for photometric monitoring with the TAOS telescopes. This paper presents our initial analysis of a search for periodic variable stars from the time-series TAOS data on one particular TAOS field, No. 151 (R. A. = 17(h)30(m)6(s).7, decl. = 27 degrees 17'30 '', J2000), which had been observed over 47 epochs in 2005. A total of 81 candidate variables are identified in the 3 deg(2) field, with magnitudes in the range 8 < R < 16. On the basis of the periodicity and shape of the light curves, 29 variables, 15 of which were previously unknown, are classified as RR Lyrae, Cepheid, delta Scuti, SX Phonencis, semi-regular, and eclipsing binaries.

ID POLARIZATION
AB Context. Bolometric interferometry is a promising new technology with potential applications to the detection of B-mode polarization fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). A bolometric interferometer will have to take advantage of the wide spectral detection band of its bolometers to be competitive with imaging experiments. A crucial concern is that interferometers are assumed to be significantly affected by a spoiling effect known as bandwidth smearing.
   Aims. We investigate how the bandwidth modifies the work principle of a bolometric interferometer and affects its sensitivity to the CMB angular power spectra.
   Methods. We obtain analytical expressions for the broadband visibilities measured by broadband heterodyne and bolometric interferometers. We investigate how the visibilities must be reconstructed in a broadband bolometric interferometer and show that this critically depends on hardware properties of the modulation phase shifters. If the phase shifters produce shifts that are constant with respect to frequency, the instrument works like its monochromatic version (the modulation matrix is not modified), while if they vary (linearly or otherwise) with respect to frequency, one has to perform a special reconstruction scheme, which allows the visibilities to be reconstructed in frequency subbands. Using an angular power spectrum estimator that accounts for the bandwidth, we finally calculate the sensitivity of a broadband bolometric interferometer. A numerical simulation is performed that confirms the analytical results.
   Results. We conclude that (i) broadband bolometric interferometers allow broadband visibilities to be reconstructed regardless of the type of phase shifters used and (ii) for dedicated B-mode bolometric interferometers, the sensitivity loss caused by bandwidth smearing is quite acceptable, even for wideband instruments (a factor of 2 loss for a typical 20% bandwidth experiment).

AB We investigate the relationship between R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars and hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) stars by measuring precise (16)O/(18)O ratios for five cool RCB stars. The (16)O/(18)O ratios are derived by spectrum synthesis from high-resolution (R similar to 50,000) K-band spectra. Lower limits to the (16)O/(17)O and (14)N/(15)N ratios as well as Na and S abundances (when possible) are also given. RCB stars in our sample generally display less (18)O than HdC stars-the derived (16)O/(18)O ratios range from 3 to 20. The only exception is the RCB star WX CrA, which seems to be an HdC-like star with (16)O/(18)O = 0.3. Our result of a higher (16)O/(18)O ratio for the RCB stars must be accounted for by a theory of the formation and evolution of HdC and RCB stars. We speculate that a late dredge-up of products of He burning, principally (12)C and (16)O, may convert an (18)O-rich HdC star into an (18)O-poor RCB star as the H-deficient star begins its final evolution from a cool supergiant to the top of the white dwarf cooling track.

AB We estimate cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization and temperature power spectra using Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5 year foreground contaminated maps. The power spectrum is estimated by using a model-independent method, which does not utilize directly the diffuse foreground templates nor the detector noise model. The method essentially consists of two steps: (1) removal of diffuse foregrounds contamination by making linear combination of individual maps in harmonic space and (2) cross-correlation of foreground cleaned maps to minimize detector noise bias. For the temperature power spectrum we also estimate and subtract residual unresolved point source contamination in the cross-power spectrum using the point source model provided by the WMAP science team. Our TT, TE, and EE power spectra are in good agreement with the published results of the WMAP science team. We perform detailed numerical simulations to test for bias in our procedure. We find that the bias is small in almost all cases. A negative bias at low l in TT power spectrum has been pointed out in an earlier publication. We find that the bias-corrected quadrupole power (l(l + 1) C-l/2 pi) is 532 mu K-2, approximately 2.5 times the estimate (213.4 mu K-2) made by the WMAP team.

AB The thermodynamics of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole at the charge-to-mass ratio of root 3/2 is studied. We show that there exists infinite discontinuity not only in the heat capacity but also in the electromagnetic potential and hence in the Gibbs free energy. Despite the existence of an infinite discontinuity in the heat capacity, it is shown that there exists no phase transition in the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. The discontinuity may be merely an artefact of the change in the slope of the vertical bar Q vertical bar vs. M curve when the charge-to-mass ratio crosses root 3/2. This may signify that the horizon temperature is not a well-behaved thermodynamic parameter in the black hole thermodynamics.

AB The effects of arbitrary radiative heat-loss functions and Hall current on the self-gravitational instability of a homogeneous, viscous, rotating plasma has been investigated incorporating the effects of finite electrical resistivity, finite electron inertia and thermal conductivity. A general dispersion relation is obtained using the normal mode analysis with the help of relevant linearized perturbation equations of the problem, and a modified Jeans criterion of instability is obtained. The conditions of modified Jeans instabilities and stabilities are discussed in the different cases of our interest. We find that the presence of arbitrary radiative heat-loss functions and thermal conductivity modifies the fundamental Jeans criterion of gravitational instability into a radiative instability criterion. The Hall parameter affects only the longitudinal mode of propagation and it has no effect on the transverse mode of propagation. For longitudinal propagation, it is found that the condition of radiative instability is independent of the magnetic field, Hall parameter, finite electron inertia, finite electrical resistivity, viscosity and rotation; but for the transverse mode of propagation it depends on the finite electrical resistivity, the strength of the magnetic field, and it is independent of rotation, electron inertia and viscosity. From the curves we find that the presence of thermal conductivity, finite electrical resistivity and density-dependent heat-loss function has a destabilizing influence, while viscosity and magnetic field have a stabilizing effect on the growth rate of an instability. The effect of arbitrary heat-loss functions is also studied on the growth rate of a radiative instability.

AB Several features of electrostatics of point charged particles in a weak, homogeneous, gravitational field are discussed using the Rindler metric to model the gravitational field. Some previously known results are obtained by simpler and more transparent procedures and are interpreted in an intuitive manner. Specifically: (a) We discuss possible definitions of the electric field in curved spacetime (and noninertial frames), argue in favour of a specific definition for the electric field and discuss its properties. (b) We show that the electrostatic potential of a charge at rest in the Rindler frame (which is known and is usually expressed as a complicated function of the coordinates) is expressible as A (0) = q/lambda where lambda is the affine parameter distance along the null geodesic from the charge to the field point. (c) This relates well with the result that the electric field lines of a charge coincide with the null geodesics; that is, both light and the electric field lines 'bend' in the same manner in a weak gravitational field. We provide a simple proof for this result as well as for the fact that the null geodesics (and field lines) are circles in space. (d) We obtain the sum of the electrostatic forces exerted by one charge on another in the Rindler frame and discuss its interpretation. In particular, we compare the results in the Rindler frame and in the inertial frame and discuss their consistency. (e) We show how a purely electrostatic term in the Rindler frame appears as a radiation term in the inertial frame. (In part, this arises because charges at rest in a weak gravitational field possess additional weight due to their electrostatic energy. This weight is proportional to the acceleration and falls inversely with distance-which are the usual characteristics of a radiation field.) (f) We also interpret the origin of the radiation reaction term by extending our approach to include a slowly varying acceleration. Many of these results might have possible extensions for the case of electrostatics in an arbitrary static geometry.

AB We apply the covariant anomaly cancellation method to compute the Hawking fluxes from the event and cosmic horizons of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole. The derivation is new from the existing ones as we split the space in three different regions (near to and away from the event and cosmic horizons) and write down the covariant energy-momentum tensor using three step functions which covers the whole region leading elegantly to the conditions required to compute the Hawking fluxes from the event and cosmic horizons.

AB In this paper, we have studied the geometry of the five-dimensional black hole solutions in (a) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet theory and (b) Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a cosmological constant for spherically symmetric space time. Formulating the Ruppeiner metric, we have examined the possible phase transition for both the metrics. It is found that depending on some restrictions phase transition is possible for the black holes. Also for I > = 0 in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole, the Ruppeiner metric becomes flat and hence the black hole becomes a stable one.

AB A black hole accretion may have both the Keplerian and the sub-Keplerian component. In the so-called Chakrabarti-Titarchuk scenario, the Keplerian component supplies low-energy (soft) photons while the sub-Keplerian component supplies hot electrons which exchange their energy with the soft photons through Comptonization or inverse Comptonization processes. In the sub-Keplerian component, a shock is generally produced due to the centrifugal force. The postshock region is known as the CENtrifugal pressure-supported BOundary Layer (CENBOL). In this paper, we compute the effects of the thermal and the bulk motion Comptonization on the soft photons emitted from a Keplerian disk by the CENBOL, the preshock sub-Keplerian disk and the outflowing jet. We study the emerging spectrum when the converging inflow and the diverging outflow (generated from the CENBOL) are simultaneously present. From the strength of the shock, we calculate the percentage of matter being carried away by the outflow and determine how the emerging spectrum depends on the outflow rate. The preshock sub-Keplerian flow is also found to Comptonize the soft photons significantly. The interplay between the up-scattering and down-scattering effects determines the effective shape of the emerging spectrum. By simulating several cases with various inflow parameters, we conclude that whether the preshock flow, or the postshock CENBOL or the emerging jet is dominant in shaping the emerging spectrum depends strongly on the geometry of the flow and the strength of the shock in the sub-Keplerian flow.

AB This paper reports new observations of pulsars B0943+10 and B1822-09 carried out with the Arecibo Observatory and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, respectively. Both stars exhibit two stable emission modes. We report the discovery in B0943+10 of a highly linearly polarized 'precursor' (PC) component that occurs primarily in only one mode. This emission feature closely resembles B1822-09's PC which also occurs brightly in only one mode. B0943+10's other mode is well known for its highly regular drifting subpulses that are apparently produced by a rotating 'carousel' system of 20 'beamlets.' Similarly, B1822-09 exhibits subpulse-modulation behaviour only in the mode where its PC is absent. We survey our 18 h of B0943+10 observations and find that the 'sideband'- modulation features, from which the carousel-rotation time can be directly determined, occur rarely - less than 5 per cent of the time - but always indicating 20 'beamlets'. We present an analysis of B1822-09's modal modulation characteristics at 325 MHz and compare them in detail with B0943+10. The pulsar never seems to null, and we find a 43-rotation-period P(3) feature in the star's 'Q' mode that modulates the interpulse (IP) as well as the conal features in the main pulse (MP). We conclude that B1822-09 must have a nearly orthogonal geometry and that its carousel circulation time is long compared to the modal subsequences available in our observations, and the MP/IP separation is almost exactly 180 degrees. We conclude the PCs for both stars are incompatible with core-cone emission. We assess the interesting suggestion by Dyks et al. that downward-going radiation produces B1822-09's PC emission.

AB High-resolution spectra obtained from the Subaru Telescope High Dispersion Spectrograph have been used to update the stellar atmospheric parameters and metallicity of the star HD209621. We have derived a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.93 for this star, and have found a large enhancement of carbon and of heavy elements, with respect to iron. Updates on the elemental abundances of four s-process elements (Y, Ce, Pr, Nd) along with the first estimates of abundances for a number of other heavy elements (Sr, Zr, Ba, La, Sm, Eu, Er, Pb) are reported. The stellar atmospheric parameters, the effective temperature, Teff, and the surface gravity, log g (4500 K, 2.0), are determined from local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis using model atmospheres. Estimated [Ba/Eu]= +0.35, places the star in the group of CEMP( r+s) stars; however, the s-elements abundance pattern seen in HD209621 is characteristic of CH stars; notably, the second-peak s-process elements are more enhanced than the first-peak s-process elements. HD209621 is also found to show a large enhancement of the third-peak s-process element lead (Pb) with [Pb/Fe] = +1.88. The relative contributions of the two neutron-capture processes, r and s, to the observed abundances are examined using a parametric model-based analysis, which hints that the neutron-capture elements in HD209621 primarily originate in s-process.

AB We extend and investigate the spheroidal model of interstellar dust grains used to simultaneously interpret the observed interstellar extinction and polarization curves. We compare our model with similar models recently suggested by other authors, study its properties and apply it to fit the normalized extinction A(lambda)/A(V) and the polarizing efficiency P(lambda)/A(lambda) measured in the near-infrared to far-ultraviolet region for several stars seen through one large cloud. We conclude that the model parameter Omega being the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field direction can be more or less reliably determined from comparison of the theory and observations. This opens a way to study the spatial structure of interstellar magnetic fields by using multiwavelength photometric and polarimetric observations.

AB We present results obtained from extensive near-infrared spectroscopic and photometric observations of nova V574 Pup during its 2004 outburst. The observations were obtained over 4 months, starting from 2004 November 25 (4 d after the nova outburst) to 2005 March 20. The near-infrared JHK light curve is presented -it shows no evidence of the fact that dust formation has occurred during our observations. In the early decline phase, the JHK spectra of the nova are dominated by emission lines of hydrogen Brackett and Paschen series, O(I), C(I) and He(I). We also detect the fairly uncommon Fe(II) line at 1.6872 mu m in the early part of our observations. The strengths of the He I lines at 1.0830 and 2.0585 mu m are found to become very strong towards the end of the observations indicating a progression towards higher excitation conditions in the nova ejecta. The width of the emission lines does not show any significant change during the course of our observations. The slope of the continuum spectrum was found to have a lambda(-2.75) dependence in the early stages which gradually becomes flatter with time and changes to a free-free spectral dependence towards the later stages. Recombination analysis of the HI lines shows deviations from case B conditions during the initial stages. However, towards the end of our observations, the line strengths are well simulated with case B model values with electron density n(e) = 109(-10) cm(-3) and a temperature equal to 10(4)K. Based on our distance estimate to the nova of 5.5 kpc and the observed free-free continuum emission in the later part of the observations, we estimate the ionized mass of the ejecta to be between 10(-5) and 10(-6)M(circle dot).

These observations were made with the objectives of estimating their spectral ages and examining any evidence of diffuse extended emission at low radio frequencies due to an earlier cycle of activity. While no evidence of extended emission due to an earlier cycle of activity has been found, the spectral ages have been estimated to be similar to 15 and 27 Myr for the oldest relativistic plasma seen in the regions close to the cores for 3C46 and 3C452, respectively. The spectra in the vicinity of the hotspots are consistent with a straight spectrum with injection spectral indices of similar to 1.0 and 0.78, respectively, somewhat steeper than theoretical expectations.

AB We present the simplest model that permits a largely analytical exploration of the m = 1 counter-rotating instability in a 'hot' nearly Keplerian disc of collisionless self-gravitating matter. The model consists of a two-component softened gravity disc, whose linear modes are analysed using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. The modes are slow in the sense that their (complex) frequency is smaller than the Keplerian orbital frequency by a factor which is of order the ratio of the disc mass to the mass of the central object. Very simple analytical expressions are derived for the precession frequencies and growth rates of local modes; it is shown that a nearly Keplerian disc must be unrealistically hot to avoid an overstability. Global modes are constructed for the case of zero net rotation.

AB Hoyle & Fowler showed that there could be radiation pressure supported stars (RPSSs) even in Newtonian gravity. Much later, Mitra found that one could also conceive of their general relativistic (GR) version, 'relativistic radiation pressure supported stars' (RRPSSs). While RPSSs have z << 1, RRPSSs have z >> 1, where z is the surface gravitational redshift. Here, we elaborate on the formation of RRPSSs during continued gravitational collapse by recalling that a contracting massive star must start trapping radiation as it enters its photon sphere. It is found that, irrespective of the details of the contraction process, the trapped radiation flux should attain the corresponding Eddington value at sufficiently large z >> 1. This means that continued GR collapse may generate an intermediate RRPSS with z >> 1 before a true black hole state with z = infinity is formed asymptotically. An exciting consequence of this is that the stellar mass black hole candidates, at the present epoch, should be hot balls of quark-gluon plasma, as has been discussed by Royzen in a recent article entitled 'QCD against black holes?'.

AB We present a 2-day long Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observation and simultaneous Swift data of the bright X-ray transient XTE J1752-223. Spectral and timing properties were stable during the observation. The energy spectrum is well described by a broken power law with a high-energy cut-off. A cold disc (similar to 0.3 keV) is observed when Swift/X-Ray Telescope data are considered. The fractional root mean square amplitude of the aperiodic variability (0.002-128 Hz) is 48.2 +/- 0.1 per cent, and it is not energy dependent. The continuum of the power density spectrum can be fitted by using four broad-band Lorentzians. A high-frequency (similar to 21 Hz) component and two weak quasi-periodic oscillation-like features are also present. Time lags between soft and hard X-rays roughly follow the relation Delta t proportional to nu(-0.7), with delays dropping from similar to 0.5 (0.003 Hz) to similar to 0.0015 (>= 10 Hz) s. Our results are consistent with XTE J1752-223 being a black hole candidate, with all timing and spectral components very similar to those of Cyg X-1 during its canonical hard state.

AB The angular power spectrum of H I 21 cm opacity fluctuations is a useful statistic for quantifying the observed opacity fluctuations as well as for comparing these with theoretical models. We present here the H I 21 cm opacity fluctuation power spectrum towards the supernova remnant Cas A from interferometric data with spacial resolution of 5 aresec and spectral resolution of 0.4 km s(-1). The power spectrum has been estimated using a simple but robust visibility-based technique. We find that the power spectrum is well fitted by a power law P(tau)(U) = U(alpha) with a power-law index of alpha similar to -2.86 +/- 0.10 (3 sigma error) over the scales of 0.07-2.3 pc for the gas in the Perseus spiral arm and 0.002-0.07 pc (480-15 730 au) for that in the local arm. This estimated power-law index is consistent with earlier observational results based on both H I emission over larger scales and absorption studies over a similar range of scales. We do not detect any statistically significant change in the power-law index with the velocity width of the frequency channels. This constrains the power-law index of the velocity structure function to be beta = 0.2 +/- 0.6 (3 sigma error).

AB We determine the intrinsic axial ratio distribution of the gas discs of extremely faint M-B < -14.5 dwarf irregular galaxies. We start with the measured (beam corrected) distribution of apparent axial ratios in the H I 21-cm images of dwarf irregular galaxies observed as part of the Faint Irregular Galaxy GMRT Survey (FIGGS). Assuming that the discs can be approximated as oblate spheroids, the intrinsic axial ratio distribution can be obtained from the observed apparent axial ratio distribution. We use a variety of methods to do this, and our final results are based on using Lucy's deconvolution algorithm. This method is constrained to produce physically plausible distributions, and also has the added advantage of allowing for observational errors to be accounted for. While one might a priori expect that gas discs would be thin (because collisions between gas clouds would cause them to quickly settle down to a thin disc), we find that the H I discs of faint dwarf irregulars are quite thick, with mean axial ratio < q > similar to 0.6. While this is substantially larger than the typical value of similar to 0.2 for the stellar discs of large spiral galaxies, it is consistent with the much larger ratio of velocity dispersion to rotational velocity (sigma/v(c)) in dwarf galaxy H I discs as compared to that in spiral galaxies. Our findings have implications for studies of the mass distribution and the Tully-Fisher relation for faint dwarf irregular galaxies, where it is often assumed that the gas is in a thin disc.

AB Direct detection of water in its vapour phase in the tenuous lunar environment through in situ measurements carried out by the Chandra's Altitudinal Composition Explorer (CHACE) payload, onboard the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) of Chandrayaan I mission vindicates the presence of water on the surface of the moon in form of ice at higher lunar latitudes inferred from IR absorption spectroscopy, (especially that of OH), by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M-3) of Chandrayaan I. The quadrupole mass spectrometer based payload. CHACE, sampled the lunar neutral atmosphere every 4 s with a broad latitudinal (similar to 40 degrees N to 90 degrees S, with a resolution of similar to 0.1 degrees) and altitudinal (from 98 km up to impact on the lunar surface with a resolution of similar to 0.25 km) coverage in the sunlit side of the moon for the first time. These two (CHACE and M-3) complementary experiments are shown to collectively provide unambiguous signatures for the distribution of water in solid and gaseous phases in Earth's moon.

AB Non-similarity solutions are obtained for one-dimensional isothermal and adiabatic flow behind strong cylindrical shock wave propagation in a rotational axisymmetric dusty gas, which has a variable azimuthal and axial fluid velocity. The dusty gas is assumed to be a mixture of small solid particles and perfect gas. The equilibrium flow conditions are assumed to be maintained, and the density of the mixture is assumed to be varying and obeying an exponential law. The fluid velocities in the ambient medium are assumed to obey exponential laws. The shock wave moves with variable velocity. The effects of variation of the mass concentration of solid particles in the mixture, and the ratio of the density of solid particles to the initial density of the gas on the flow variables in the region behind the shock are investigated at given times. Also, a comparison between the solutions in the cases of isothermal and adiabatic flows is made.

AB The relationship between the velocity of CMEs and the plasma temperature of the associated X-ray solar flares is investigated. The velocity of CMEs increases with plasma temperature (R = 0.82) and photon index below the break energy (R = 0.60) of X-ray flares. The heating of the coronal plasma appears to be significant with respect to the kinetics of a CME from the reconnection region where the flare also occurs. We propose that the initiation and velocity of CMEs perhaps depend upon the dominant process of conversion of the magnetic field energy of the active region to heating/accelerating the coronal plasma in the reconnected loops. Results show that a flare and the associated CME are two components of one energy release system, perhaps, magnetic field free energy.

We found several relations for individual ORB pulses between the spectral lag and other observables, such as the luminosity, pulse duration, and peak energy, E-peak. The obtained results are consistent with those for BATSE, indicating that the BATSE correlations are still valid at lower energies (6-25 keV). Furthermore, we found that the photon energy dependence for the spectral lags can be reconciled with the simple curvature effect model. We discuss the implications of these results from various points of view.

AB In situ measurements carried out by the SROSS C2 satellite during the ascending half of solar cycle 23 from 1995 to 2000 are used to study the effect of changes in solar activity on diurnal, seasonal, and latitudinal variations of O(+), H(+), He(+), and O(2)(+) ions at an average altitude of similar to 500 km over the Indian latitude and longitude sector. FORMOSAT-1 measurements at 600 km over Indian low and equatorial latitudes are also analyzed for diurnal and seasonal variations in O(+), H(+), and He(+) concentrations from 1999 to 2003. O(+) dominates these altitudes and exhibits the expected diurnal variations of minimum before local sunrise and maximum in noontime or afternoon hours. The magnitude and time of diurnal maximum vary with season and solar activity as well as latitude. H(+) density, which is about 1 order of magnitude lower than that of O(+) during the daytime in years of low solar activity, is further reduced with respect to O(+) density as solar activity increases. The concentration of He(+) is less than that of H(+) during the solar minimum. However, during periods of moderate to high solar activity, the He(+) concentration equals or is higher than that of H(+). Day and nighttime O(+) bear a good positive correlation with F(10.7) cm solar flux, while H(+) declines with increases in solar flux. O(2)(+) is a minor constituent at the altitude of similar to 500 km irrespective of solar activity and season of observation. It is observed that the O(2)(+) concentration increases approximately twofold from solar minimum to solar maximum. Daytime He(+) does not vary with solar flux, while the nighttime concentration of He(+) increases marginally with increases in solar flux.

AB A space gravitational-wave antenna, DECIGO (DECI-hertz interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory), will provide fruitful insights into the universe, particularly on the formation mechanism of supermassive black holes, dark energy and the inflation of the universe. In the current pre-conceptual design, DECIGO will be comprising four interferometer units; each interferometer unit will be formed by three drag-free spacecraft with 1000 km separation. Since DECIGO will be an extremely challenging mission with high-precision formation flight with long baseline, it is important to increase the technical feasibility before its planned launch in 2027. Thus, we are planning to launch two milestone missions. DECIGO pathfinder (DPF) is the first milestone mission, and key components for DPF are being tested on ground and in orbit. In this paper, we review the conceptual design and current status of DECIGO and DPF.

AB We report a transit timing study of the transiting exoplanetary system HD 189733. In total, we observed 10 transits in 2006 and 2008 with the 2.6-m Nordic Optical Telescope, and two transits in 2007 with the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope. We used Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to derive the system parameters and their uncertainties, and our results are in a good agreement with previously published values. We performed two independent analyses of transit timing residuals to place upper mass limits on putative perturbing planets. The results show no evidence for the presence of planets down to 1 Earth mass near the 1: 2 and 2: 1 resonance orbits, and planets down to 2.2 Earth masses near the 3: 5 and 5: 3 resonance orbits with HD 189733b. These are the strongest limits to date on the presence of other planets in this system.

TI SOLAR-LIKE OSCILLATIONS IN LOW-LUMINOSITY RED GIANTS: FIRST RESULTS FROM

AB We have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-series photometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the Kepler Mission. The light curves, obtained with 30 minute sampling, reveal clear oscillations in a large sample of G and K giants, extending in luminosity from the red clump down to the bottom of the giant branch. We confirm a strong correlation between the large separation of the oscillations (Delta nu) and the frequency of maximum power (nu(max)). We focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars (nu(max) > 100 mu Hz, L less than or similar to 30 L(circle dot)) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing the unambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. These are H-shell-burning stars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellar evolution and for constraining the star formation rate in the local disk. We use a new technique to compare stars on a single echelle diagram by scaling their frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial and non-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degree l = 3. Measuring the small separation between l = 0 and l = 2 allows us to plot the so-called C-D diagram of delta nu(02) versus Delta nu. The small separation delta nu(01) of l = 1 from the midpoint of adjacent l = 0 modes is negative, contrary to the Sun and solar-type stars. The ridge for l = 1 is notably broadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoretical predictions for low-luminosity giants. Overall, the results demonstrate the tremendous potential of Kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.

AB We present preliminary asteroseismic results from Kepler on three G-type stars. The observations, made at one-minute cadence during the first 33.5 days of science operations, reveal high signal-to-noise solar-like oscillation spectra in all three stars: about 20 modes of oscillation may be clearly distinguished in each star. We discuss the appearance of the oscillation spectra, use the frequencies and frequency separations to provide first results on the radii, masses, and ages of the stars, and comment in the light of these results on prospects for inference on other solar-type stars that Kepler will observe.

TI DETECTION OF SOLAR-LIKE OSCILLATIONS FROM KEPLER PHOTOMETRY OF THE OPEN

AB Asteroseismology of stars in clusters has been a long-sought goal because the assumption of a common age, distance, and initial chemical composition allows strong tests of the theory of stellar evolution. We report results from the first 34 days of science data from the Kepler Mission for the open cluster NGC 6819-one of the four clusters in the field of view. We obtain the first clear detections of solar-like oscillations in the cluster red giants and are able to measure the large frequency separation, Delta nu, and the frequency of maximum oscillation power, nu(max). We find that the asteroseismic parameters allow us to test cluster membership of the stars, and even with the limited seismic data in hand, we can already identify four possible non-members despite their having a better than 80% membership probability from radial velocity measurements. We are also able to determine the oscillation amplitudes for stars that span about 2 orders of magnitude in luminosity and find good agreement with the prediction that oscillation amplitudes scale as the luminosity to the power of 0.7. These early results demonstrate the unique potential of asteroseismology of the stellar clusters observed by Kepler.

AB Measurement of at least three independent parameters, for example, mass, radius and spin frequency, of a neutron star is probably the only way to understand the nature of its supranuclear core matter. Such a measurement is extremely difficult because of various systematic uncertainties. The lack of knowledge of several system parameter values gives rise to such systematics Low mass X-ray binaries, which contain neutron stars, provide a number of methods to constrain the stellar parameters Joint application of these methods has a great potential to significantly reduce the systematic uncertainties, and hence to measure three independent neutron star parameters accurately Here, we review the methods based on (I) thermonuclear X-ray bursts, (2) accretion-powered millisecond-period pulsations, (3) kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations, (4) broad relativistic Iron lines, (5) quiescent emissions, and (6) binary orbital motions (C) 2010 COSPAR.

TI Statistical isotropy violation of the CMB brightness fluctuations

   BACKGROUND ANISOTROPY; SKY MAPS; ANOMALIES; SCALES
AB Certain anomalies at large angular scales in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) measured by WMAP have been suggested as possible evidence of breakdown of statistical isotropy (SI). SI violation of cosmological perturbations is a generic feature of ultralarge scale structure of the cosmos and breakdown of global symmetries. Most CMB photons free-stream to the present from the surface of last scattering. It is thus reasonable to expect statistical isotropy violation in the CMB photon distribution observed now to have originated from SI violation in the baryon-photon fluid at last scattering, in addition to anisotropy of the primordial power spectrum studied earlier in the literature. We consider the generalized anisotropic brightness distribution fluctuations, Delta((k) over right arrow, (n) over cap, tau) (at conformal time tau) in contrast to the SI case where it is simply a function of vertical bar(k) over right arrow vertical bar and (n) over cap. The brightness fluctuations expanded in bipolar spherical harmonic (BipoSH) series can then be written as Delta(LM)(l1l2)(k, tau), where L > 0 terms encode deviations from statistical isotropy. Violation of SI encoded in the present off-diagonal elements of the harmonic space correlation < a(lm)a(l1m1)* >, equivalently, the BipoSH coefficients A(ll1)(LM), are then related to the generalized BipoSH brightness fluctuation terms at present. We study the evolution of Delta(LM)(l1l2) (k,tau) from nonzero terms Delta(LM)(l3l4) (k, tau(s)) at last scattering, in the free-streaming regime. We show that the terms with given BipoSH multipole LM evolve independently. Moreover, similar to the SI case, power at small spherical harmonic (SH) multipoles of Delta(LM)(l3l4) (k, tau(s)) at the last scattering is transferred to Delta(LM)(l1l2) (k,tau) at larger SH multipoles. The structural similarity is more apparent in the asymptotic expression for large values of the final SH multipoles. This formalism allows an elegant identification of any SI violation observed today to a possible origin in SI violating physics present in the baryon-photon fluid. This is illustrated for the known result of SI violating angular correlations due to the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field in the baryon-photon fluid.

DT Article
ID TRANSIENT RELATIVISTIC THERMODYNAMICS
AB The AdS/CFT correspondence defines a sector with universal strongly coupled dynamics in the field theory as the dual of pure gravity in AdS described by Einstein's equation with a negative cosmological constant. We explain here, from the field-theoretic viewpoint how the dynamics in this sector gets determined by the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor alone. We first show that the Boltzmann equation has very special solutions which could be functionally completely determined in terms of the energy-momentum tensor alone. We call these solutions conservative solutions. We indicate why conservative solutions should also exist when we refine this kinetic description to go closer to the exact microscopic theory or even move away from the regime of weak coupling so that no kinetic description could be employed. We argue that these conservative solutions form the universal sector dual to pure gravity at strong coupling and large N. Based on this observation, we propose a regularity condition on the energy-momentum tensor so that the dual solution in pure gravity has a smooth future horizon. We also study if irreversibility emerges only at long time scales of observation, unlike the case of the Boltzmann equation.

AB Dark energy must cluster in order to be consistent with the equivalence principle. The background evolution can be effectively modeled by either a scalar field or by a barotropic fluid. The fluid model can be used to emulate perturbations in a scalar field model of dark energy, though this model breaks down at large scales. In this paper we study evolution of dark energy perturbations in canonical scalar field models: the classes of thawing and freezing models. The dark energy equation of state evolves differently in these classes. In freezing models, the equation of state deviates from that of a cosmological constant at early times. For thawing models, the dark energy equation of state remains near that of the cosmological constant at early times and begins to deviate from it only at late times. Since the dark energy equation of state evolves differently in these classes, the dark energy perturbations too evolve differently. In freezing models, since the equation of state deviates from that of a cosmological constant at early times, there is a significant difference in evolution of matter perturbations from those in the cosmological constant model. In comparison, matter perturbations in thawing models differ from the cosmological constant only at late times. This difference provides an additional handle to distinguish between these classes of models and this difference should manifest itself in the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect.

AB Deviations from statistical isotropy can be modeled in various ways, for instance, anisotropic cosmological models (Bianchi models), compact topologies, and presence of primordial magnetic field. Signature of anisotropy manifests itself in cosmic microwave background correlation patterns. Here we explore the symmetries of the correlation function and its implications on the observable measures constructed within the bipolar harmonic formalism for these variety of models. Different quantifiers within the bipolar harmonic representation are used to distinguish between plausible models of breakdown of statistical isotropy and as a spectroscopic tool for discriminating between distinct cosmic topology.

AB This paper presents integrated magnitudes and colours for synthetic clusters. The integrated parameters have been obtained for the whole cluster population as well as for the main-sequence (MS) population of star clusters. We have also estimated observed integrated magnitudes and colours of the MS population of galactic open clusters, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) star clusters. It is found that the colour evolution of the MS population of star clusters is not affected by the stochastic fluctuations, however, these fluctuations significantly affect the colour evolution of the whole cluster population. The fluctuations are maximum in (V - I) colour in the age range 6.7 < log(age) < 7.5. Evolution of integrated colours of the MS population of clusters in the Milky Way, LMC and SMC, obtained in the present study is well explained by the present synthetic cluster model. The observed integrated (B - V) colours of the MS population of LMC star clusters having age >= 500 Myr seem to be distributed around the Z = 0.004 model, whereas (V - I) colours are found to be bluer than those predicted by the Z = 0.004 model. The (V - I) versus (B - V) two-colour diagram for the MS population of the Milky Way star clusters shows a fair agreement between the observations and present model, however, the diagrams for LMC and SMC clusters indicate that observed (V - I) colours are relatively bluer. Possible reasons for this anomaly have been discussed. Comparison of the synthetic (U - B) versus (B - V) relation with the observed integrated parameters of the whole cluster population of the Milky Way, LMC and SMC star clusters indicates that the majority of the bluest clusters [(B - V)(0) < 0.0] follow the MS population relation. The colour evolution of young Milky Way, LMC and SMC clusters [6.5 < log(age) < 8.0] also indicates that a large number of young clusters follow the MS population relation. Therefore, in the absence of a careful modelling of stochastic effects, age determination of young star clusters by comparing their integrated colours with whole cluster synthetic colours may yield erroneous results.

AB We present multiwavelength linear polarimetric observations of 104 stars towards the region of young open cluster NGC 6823. The polarization towards NGC 6823 is dominated by foreground dust grains and we found evidence for the presence of several layers of dust towards the line of sight. The first layer of dust is approximately located within 200 pc towards the cluster, which is much closer to the Sun than the cluster itself (similar to 2.1 kpc). The radial distribution of the position angles for the member stars is found to show a systematic change, while the polarization is found to reduce towards the outer parts of the cluster and the average position angle of the coronal region of the cluster is very close to the inclination of the Galactic parallel (similar to 32 degrees). The size distribution of the grains within NGC 6823 is similar to those in the general interstellar medium. The patchy distribution of foreground dust grains is suggested to be mainly responsible for both differential reddening and polarization towards NGC 6823. The majority of the observed stars do not show evidence of intrinsic polarization in their light.

AB The mechanism by which outflows and plausible jets are driven from black hole systems still remains observationally elusive. This notwithstanding, several observational evidences and deeper theoretical insights reveal that accretion and outflow/jet are strongly correlated. We model an advective disk-outflow coupled dynamics, incorporating explicitly the vertical flux. Inter-connecting dynamics of outflow and accretion essentially upholds the conservation laws. We investigate the properties of the disk-outflow surface and its strong dependence on the rotation parameter of the black hole. The energetics of the disk outflow strongly depend on the mass, accretion rate, and spin of the black holes. The model clearly shows that the outflow power extracted from the disk increases strongly with the spin of the black hole, inferring that the power of the observed astrophysical jets has a proportional correspondence with the spin of the central object. In the case of blazars (BL Lacs and flat spectrum radio quasars, FSRQs), most of their emission are believed to be originated from their jets. It is observed that BL Lacs are relatively low luminous than FSRQs. The luminosity might be linked to the power of the jet, which in turn reflects that the nuclear regions of the BL Lac objects have a relatively low spinning black hole compared to that in the case of FSRQs. If extreme gravity is the source that powers strong outflows and jets, then the spin of the black hole, perhaps, might be the fundamental parameter to account for the observed astrophysical processes in an accretion powered system.

AB We present results from the Suzaku observation of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 performed during the 2005 October multiwavelength campaign. The data include both stable state (class chi) and limit-cycle oscillation (class theta). Correct interstellar absorption as well as effects of dust scattering are fully taken into account in the spectral analysis. The energy spectra in the 2-120 keV band in both states are all dominated by strong Comptonization of disk photons by optically thick (tau approximate to 7-10) and low-temperature (T-e approximate to 2-3 keV) hybrid plasmas containing non-thermal electrons produced with 10%-60% of the total power input. Absorption lines of highly ionized Fe ions detected during the oscillation indicate that a strong disk wind is developed. The ionization stage of the wind correlates with the X-ray flux, supporting the photoionization origin. The iron-K emission line shows a strong variability during the oscillation; the reflection is strongest during the dip but disappears during the flare. We interpret this as evidence for "self-shielding" that the Comptonizing corona becomes geometrically thick in the flare phase, preventing photons from irradiating the outer disk. The low-temperature and high-luminosity disk emission suggests that the disk structure is similar to that in the very high state of canonical black hole binaries. The spectral variability during the oscillation is explained by the change of the disk geometry and of the physical parameters of Comptonizing corona, particularly the fractional power supplied to the acceleration of non-thermal particles.

AB We present a search for gravitational waves from 116 known millisecond and young pulsars using data from the fifth science run of the LIGO detectors. For this search, ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for all pulsars using radio and X-ray observations. We demonstrate an updated search method that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to be included in the search. We report no signal detection from any of the targets and therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wave signal strength. The most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. We present updated limits on gravitational radiation from the Crab pulsar, where the measured limit is now a factor of 7 below the spin-down limit. This limits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than similar to 2% of the available spin-down power. For the X-ray pulsar J0537-6910 we reach the spin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from it stays phase locked to the X-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsars J1913+1011 and J1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-down limit. Of the recycled millisecond pulsars, several of themeasured upper limits are only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. For these our best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is 2.3 x 10(-26) for J1603-7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is 7.0 x 10(-8) for J2124-3358.

AB We propose a new solution to the origin of dark energy. We suggest that it was created dynamically from the condensate of a singlet neutrino at a late epoch of the early Universe through its effective self-interaction. This singlet neutrino is also the Dirac partner of one of the three observed neutrinos, hence dark energy is related to neutrino mass. The onset of this condensate formation in the early Universe is also related to matter density and offers an explanation of the coincidence problem of why dark energy (70%) and total matter (30%) are comparable at the present time. We demonstrate this idea in a model of neutrino mass with (right-handed) singlet neutrinos and a singlet scalar. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Nuclear collisions recreate conditions in the universe microseconds after the Big Bang. Only a very small fraction of the emitted fragments are light nuclei, but these states are of fundamental interest. We report the observation of antihypertritons-comprising an antiproton, an antineutron, and an antilambda hyperon-produced by colliding gold nuclei at high energy. Our analysis yields 70 +/- 17 antihypertritons (3/Lambda(H) over bar) and 157 +/- 30 hypertritons (H-3(Lambda)). The measured yields of H-3(Lambda) (3/Lambda(H) over bar) and He-3 ((3)(He) over bar) are similar, suggesting an equilibrium in coordinate and momentum space populations of up, down, and strange quarks and antiquarks, unlike the pattern observed at lower collision energies. The production and properties of antinuclei, and of nuclei containing strange quarks, have implications spanning nuclear and particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.

AB We have analyzed the first 3.75 years of data from the Taiwanese American Occultation Survey (TAOS). TAOS monitors bright stars to search for occultations by Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs). This data set comprises 5 x 10(5) star hours of multi-telescope photometric data taken at 4 or 5 Hz. No events consistent with KBO occultations were found in this data set. We compute the number of events expected for the Kuiper Belt formation and evolution models of Pan & Sari, Kenyon & Bromley, Benavidez & Campo Bagatin, and Fraser. A comparison with the upper limits we derive from our data constrains the parameter space of these models. This is the first detailed comparison of models of the KBO size distribution with data from an occultation survey. Our results suggest that the KBO population is composed of objects with low internal strength and that planetary migration played a role in the shaping of the size distribution.

AB In this paper, we present for the first time a proper-motion-selected white dwarf (WD) sample of the old Galactic open cluster M 67, down to the bottom of the WD cooling sequence (CS). The color-magnitude diagram is based on data collected with the LBC-Blue camera at the prime-focus of LBT. As first epoch data, we used CFHT-archive images collected 10 years before LBC data. We measured proper motions of all the identified sources. Proper motions are then used to separate foreground and background objects from the cluster stars, including WDs. Finally, the field-object cleaned WD CS in the V vs. B-I color-magnitude diagram is compared with the models. We confirm that the age derived from the location of the bottom of the WD CS is consistent with the turn off age.

AB Context. Rotation and magnetic activity are intimately linked in main-sequence stars of G or later spectral types. The presence and level of magnetic activity depend on stellar rotation, and rotation itself is strongly influenced by the strength and topology of the magnetic fields. Open clusters represent especially useful targets for investigating the connection among rotation, activity, and age. Over time, stellar activity and rotation evolve, providing us with a promising diagnostic tool to determine the age of the field stars.
   Aims. The open cluster M11 has been studied as a part of the RACE-OC project (Rotation and ACtivity Evolution in Open Clusters), which aims to explore the evolution of rotation and magnetic activity in the late-type members of open clusters with different ages.
   Methods. Photometric observations of the open cluster M11 were carried out in June 2004 using the LOAO 1 m telescope. The rotation periods of the cluster members were determined by Fourier analysis of photometric data time series. We investigated the relations between the surface activity, characterized by the light curve amplitude, and rotation.
   Results. We have discovered a total of 75 periodic variables in the M11 FoV, of which 38 are candidate cluster members. Specifically, among cluster members we discovered 6 early-type periodic variables, 2 eclipsing binaries, and 30 bona-fide single periodic late-type variables. Considering the rotation periods of 16 G-type members of the almost coeval 200-Myr M34 cluster, we could determine the rotation period distribution from a more numerous sample of 46 single G stars at an age of about 200-230 Myr and determine a median rotation period of P = 4.8 d.
   Conclusions. A comparison with the younger M35 cluster (similar to 150 Myr) and with the older M37 cluster (similar to 550 Myr) shows that G stars rotate more slowly than younger M35 stars and more rapidly than older M37 stars. The measured variation in the median rotation period is consistent with the scenario of rotational braking of main-sequence spotted stars as they age. Finally, G-type M11 members have a level of photospheric magnetic activity, as measured by light curve amplitude, comparable to what is observed in the younger 110-Myr Pleiades stars of similar mass and rotation.

AB We have detected narrow H I 21 cm and C I absorption at z similar to 1.4-1.6 toward Q0458-020 and Q2337-011, and use these lines to test for possible changes in the fine structure constant alpha, the proton-electron mass ratio mu, and the proton gyromagnetic ratio g(p). A comparison between the H I 21 cm and C I line redshifts yields Delta X/X = (+6.8 +/- 1.0) x 10(-6) over 0 < < z > < 1.46, where X = g(p)alpha(2)/mu, and the errors are purely statistical, from the Gaussian fits. The simple line profiles and the high sensitivity of the spectra imply that statistical errors in this comparison are an order of magnitude lower than in previous studies. Further, the C I lines arise in cold neutral gas that also gives rise to H I 21 cm absorption, and both background quasars are core-dominated, reducing the likelihood of systematic errors due to local velocity offsets between the hyperfine and resonance lines. The dominant source of systematic error lies in the absolute wavelength calibration of the optical spectra, which appears uncertain to similar to 2 km s(-1), yielding a maximum error in Delta X/X of similar to 6.7 x 10(-6). Including this, we obtain Delta X/X = (+6.8 +/- 1.0(statistical) +/- 6.7(max. systematic)) x 10(-6) over 0 < < z > < 1.46. Using literature constraints on Delta mu/mu, this is inconsistent with claims of alpha smaller value of a from the many-multiplet method, unless fractional changes in g(p) are larger than those in alpha and mu.

Instead of considering only one candidate for the dark energy, we have considered the interaction between phantom field and modified Chaplygin gas. It has been shown that the potential of the phantom field increases from a lower value with evolution of the universe. It has been observed that the field has an increasing tendency and the potential has also an increasing tendency with passage of cosmic time. In the evolution of the universe the crossing of w=-1 has been realized by this interacting model.

AB In this paper we investigate the presence and temporal evolution of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) time-series and three solar parameters, namely the daily sunspot number, the coronal green line and the 10.7 cm solar radio flux over the period 1996-2003 by the wavelet technique. A number of short- and intermediate-term quasi-periodicities were also detected in both GCR and solar parameters. For the short-term range, we have identified quasi-periods of 16-30 days, 40-55 days, 60-70 days, 80-90 days and 80-100 days. In the case of intermediate range, the significant periods were 120-140 days, 150-170 days, 190-210 days, 240-260 days, a parts per thousand 1.09 yr. and a parts per thousand 1.23 yr. The wavelet power spectra show that all the above-mentioned periods are intermittent in nature and occurred in different time-series in different intervals. The result exhibits that the well-known "Rieger period" of (150-160 days) was prominent in both GCR and solar data sets during the ascending phase of cycle 23. Possible reasons behind the observed periods were discussed with the help of previous results and existing numerical models.

AB We obtain cosmological solutions which admit emergent universe (EU) scenario in the framework of Einstein Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity coupled with a dilaton field in 4-dimensions. The coupling parameter of the GB terms and the dilaton in the theory are determined for obtaining an EU scenario. The corresponding dilaton potential which admits such scenario is determined. It is found that the GB terms coupled with a dilaton field plays an important role in describing the dynamics of the evolution of the early as well as the late universe. We note an interesting case where the GB term dominates initially in the asymptotic past regime, subsequently it decreases and thereafter its contribution in determining the dynamics of the evolution dominates once again. We note that the Einstein's static universe solution permitted here is unstable which the asymptotic EU might follow. We also compare our EU model with supernova data.

AB In this paper, we investigate the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics of the universe bounded by the event horizon in the holographic dark energy (DE) model. The universe is chosen to be homogeneous and isotropic and the validity of the first law has been assumed here. The matter in the universe is taken in the form of non-interacting two fluid system: one component is the holographic DE model and the other component is in the form of dust.

AB We consider a non-minimally coupled (with gravity) scalar field with non-canonical kinetic energy. The form of the kinetic term is of Dirac-Born-Infeld form. We study the early evolution of the universe when it is sourced only by the k-field, as well as late time evolution when both the matter and k-field are present. For the k-field, we have considered constant potential as well as potential inspired from boundary string field theory. We show that it is possible to have an inflationary solution in early time as well as late time accelerating phases. The solutions also exhibit attractor properties in a sense that they do not depend on the initial conditions for certain values of the parameters.

AB We study the collapse dynamics of an inhomogeneous spherically symmetric star made of dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). The dark matter is taken in the form of a dust cloud while an anisotropic fluid is chosen as the candidate for dark energy. It is investigated how dark energy modifies the collapsing process, and it is examined whether dark energy has any effect on the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. The collapsing star is assumed to be of finite radius, and the space-time is divided into three distinct regions Sigma and V-+/-, where Sigma represents the boundary of the star and V-(V+) denotes the interior (exterior) of the star. The junction conditions for matching V-+/- over Sigma are specified. The role of Dark energy in the formation of an apparent horizon is studied, and the central singularity is analyzed.

AB In this paper we propose a class of embedded solutions of Einstein's field equations describing nonrotating Reissner-Nordstrom-Vaidya and rotating Kerr-Newman-Vaidya black holes. The Reissner-Nordstrom-Vaidya is obtained by embedding Reissner-Nordstrom solution into the nonrotating Vaidya. Similarly, we also find the Kerr-Newman-Vaidya black hole, when Kerr-Newman embeds into the rotating Vaidya solution. The Reissner-Nordstrom-Vaidya solution is type D whereas the Kerr-Newman-Vaidya metric is algebraically special of type II by the Petrov classification of space-time. These embedded solutions can be expressed in the Kerr-Schild ansatze on different backgrounds. The energy-momentum tensors for both nonrotating as well as rotating embedded solutions satisfy the energy conservation equations which show that they are solutions of Einstein's field equations. The surface gravity, area, temperature and entropy are also presented for each embedded black hole. It is observed that the area of the embedded black holes is greater than the sum of the areas of the individual ones. By considering the charge to be a function of radial coordinates it is shown that there is a change in the masses of the variably charged black holes. If such radiation continues, the mass of the black hole will evaporate completely thereby forming "instantaneous" charged black holes and creating embedded negative mass naked singularities describing the possible the life of radiation embedded black holes during their continuous radiation processes.

TI The cosmological constant and Horava-Lifshitz gravity
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS

DT Article
DE modified gravity; quantum field theory on curved space
AB Horava-Lifshitz theory of gravity with detailed balance is plagued by the presence of a negative bare (or geometrical) cosmological constant which makes its cosmology clash with observations. We argue that adding the effects of the large vacuum energy of quantum matter fields, this bare cosmological constant can be approximately compensated to account for the small observed (total) cosmological constant Lambda(OBS), thus resulting in a self-contained model of gravity and particle physics. Even though we cannot address the fine-tuning problem in this way, we are able to establish a relation between the smallness of Lambda(OBS) and the scale l(UV) at which dimension 4 corrections to the Einstein gravity become significant for cosmology. This scale turns out to be l(UV) similar or equal to 5 l(P) for Lambda(OBS) similar or equal to 0 and we therefore argue that the smallness of Lambda(OBS) guarantees that Lorentz invariance is broken only at very small scales. We are also able to provide a first rough estimation for the values of the parameters of the theory mu and Lambda(W)

AB Features in the primordial power spectrum have been suggested as an explanation for glitches in the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies measured by the WMAP satellite. However, these glitches might just as well be artifacts of noise or cosmic variance. Using the effective Delta chi(2) between the best-fit power-law spectrum and a deconvolved primordial spectrum as a measure of "featureness" of the data, we perform a full Monte-Carlo analysis to address the question of how significant the recovered features are. We find that in 26% of the simulated data sets the reconstructed spectrum yields a greater improvement in the likelihood than for the actually observed data. While features cannot be categorically ruled out by this analysis, and the possibility remains that simple theoretical models which predict some of the observed features might stand up to rigorous statistical testing, our results suggest that WMAP data are consistent with the assumption of a featureless power-law primordial spectrum.

AB This study investigates the temporal variability of longitudinal structure in F-2 layer peak height (h(m)F(2)) in the equatorial ionosphere. For this study, electron density profiles retrieved from the radio occultation measurements by the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) are fitted with a two-layer Chapman function to determine h(m)F(2). The h(m)F(2) values in the magnetic equatorial region display a four-peaked longitudinal structure that has been identified in other ionospheric observations. The four-peaked structure is likely the signature of the forcing by the eastward propagating nonmigrating diurnal tide with zonal wave number 3 (DE3). Further analysis for the period of prominent four-peaked structure over August-September 2008 finds that this structure exhibits a 5 day periodicity. Coincidentally, the all-sky interferometric meteor radar's wind measurements at Thumba (8.5 degrees N, 77 degrees E) in India for the mesosphere and lower thermosphere indicate strong 5 day planetary waves within that time period. The observed temporal periodicity of the four-peaked longitudinal structure in h(m)F(2) could thus be attributed to the interaction of DE3 with a 5 day planetary wave.

AB We present a sample of 46 [OIII]-emitting galaxies at z < 0.8 detected in the fibre spectra of quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7) through an automatic search procedure. We also detect [OII] and H beta emission lines from most of these galaxies in the SDSS spectra. We study both the emission and absorption properties of a subsample of 17 galaxies in the redshift range z = 0.4-0.7, where MgII lines are covered by the SDSS spectra. The measured lower limits on the star formation rates of these galaxies are in the range 0.2-20 M(circle dot) yr(-1). The emission-line luminosities and (O/H) metallicities from R23 measured in this sample are similar to what is found in normal galaxies at these redshifts. Thus, this constitutes a unique sample of intermediate-redshift star-forming galaxies where we can study the quasi-stellar object (QSO) absorber-galaxy connection. Strong MgII (W(lambda 2796) greater than or similar to 1 angstrom) as well as MgI absorption lines are detected in the QSO spectra at the redshift of most of these galaxies. Strong FeII (W(lambda 2600) > 1 angstrom) absorption lines are also generally detected whenever the appropriate wavelength ranges are covered. This suggests that most of these systems could be bona fide damped Lyman a systems. We investigate various possible relations between the MgII rest equivalent widths and the emission-line properties. We find a possible (2 sigma) correlation between the emission-line metallicity of the galaxies and the MgII rest equivalent width of the absorbers [log(O/H) + 12= 0.1W(lambda 2796) + 8.27], which could be a consequence of an underlyingmass-metallicity relation. However, [OIII]-selected MgII systems represent only aminor fraction of the strong MgII absorbers. We find this cannot be attributed to biases related either to the spectral signal-to-noise ratio or to the brightness of the QSOs. We measure the average observed fluxes (collected into the SDSS fibre) of the [OII] and [OIII] lines associated to MgII-selected systems through stacking technique. We find that the average luminosities of emission lines are higher for systems with larger W(lambda 2796). The stacked luminosities are found to be below the typical detection limit in individual spectra, indicating that faint galaxies can contribute appreciably to the observed population of strong MgII absorbers at intermediate redshifts. We also present long-slit spectroscopic observations of SDSS J113108+202151, the most luminous line-emitting galaxy in our z >= 0.4 sample. Surprisingly, we find that the line-emitting region does not coincide with the nearby extended bright galaxy with consistent photometric redshift seen in the SDSS image.

AB 4U 1626-67 is an accretion powered X-ray pulsar that shows remarkably stable X-ray luminosity above a time-scale of hours and gradual intensity variation on a time-scale of a few years. Unlike the other high magnetic field binary X-ray pulsars, the spin-up or spin-down rate of the neutron star is also very stable on time-scales up to several years. Here, we report a significant increase in the X-ray intensity in the long-term Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) All Sky Monitor light curve of 4U 1626-67. Similar enhancement in the X-ray flux has also been detected in the Swift Burst Alert Telescope light curve. The increase in the X-ray flux took place over a long period of about 100 d and there appear to be two episodes of flux enhancement. We have investigated the spectral and timing features of 4U 1626-67 during its current state of enhanced flux emission with data obtained from the Proportional Counter Array and the High-Energy X-ray Timing Explorer on board RXTE. We report the detection of a torque reversal to spin-up in 4U 1626-67. The source has entered a new spin-up phase with a spin-up rate of 4.02(5) x 10-13 Hz s-1. The present spin-up rate is almost half of the earlier spin-up and spin-down trends. A significant excess in soft X-ray photon emission is observed during the enhanced flux state, which is similar to the energy spectrum obtained during the spin-up era of the pulsar before 1990. 4U 1626-67 is a unique accretion powered X-ray pulsar in which quasi-periodic oscillations have been consistently observed over the past similar to 20 years. During the recent observations, however, we did not detect a quasi-periodic oscillation at frequencies as seen in earlier observations. Instead, we report detection of a significant broadening in the wings of the 130 mHz peak and a change in the shape of the continuum of the power spectrum. These results indicate that the flux enhancement is not a simple case of increased mass accretion rate, but there is also a change in the accretion geometry in the vicinity of the neutron star.

AB We perform a multilepton channel analysis in the context of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe compatible points in a model with nonuniversal scalar masses, which admits a Higgs funnel region of supersymmetry dark matter even for a small tan beta. In addition to two-and three-lepton final states, four-lepton events, too, are shown to be useful for this purpose. We also compare the collider signatures in similar channels for Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe compatible points in the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) framework with similar gluino masses. Some definite features of such nonuniversal scenario emerge from the analysis.

ID LITTLEST HIGGS-MODEL
AB Little Higgs models with T parity can easily satisfy electroweak precision tests and at the same time give a stable particle which is a candidate for cold dark matter. In addition to little Higgs heavy gauge bosons, this type of model predicts a set of new T-odd fermions, which may show quite interesting signatures at colliders. We study purely leptonic signatures of T-odd leptons at the (LHC.

AB Highly variable conditions prevail in the geospace environment due to the variations in Solar activity. The characteristics of the magnetic clouds (MCs) and their effects on geosphere, which have occurred during the period January 1996 to December 2006; have been investigated. No systematic trend has been observed between MCs and Solar activity cycle which is analyzed on the basis of maximum Sunspot number in that particular year. 85% MCs are found to be geoeffective. MCs are divided into two major classes: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar MCs are of south (S) or north (N) type while bipolar MCs are of south-north (SN) or north-south (NS) type. During Solar cycle 23, SN-type MCs dominated over NS-type MCs. Highly intense geomagnetic storms (GMSs) of Dst < -300 nT follow from SN or S-type MCs. No preference is observed for right handed (RH) or left handed (LH) clouds for being geoeffective. MCs of very high speed lead to intense GMSs. The correlation coefficient (r) of southward component of magnetic field (Bz), total magnetic field (B) and their products with plasma flow speed (VB and VBz) with Dst are observed to be r=0.78, -0.81, -0.79 and 0.82, respectively, which suggests that these parameters are reliable indicators of the strength of GMS. SN clouds do not always lead to more fall in Dst value (or lead to high strength of GMS) than NS clouds for similar value of Bz minimum associated with both type of MCs. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Lunar highland region and associated craters are mostly composed of anorthosite. In the present study, we studied the reflectance spectra of terrestrial anorthosites collected from Sittampundi Anorthosites Complex, which is considered as equivalent (simulant) of lunar highland anorthosites. The objective of the study is to interpret diagnostic spectral features of analog anorthosite for remotely exploring lunar highland region. Reflectance spectra of anorthosites were measured under two different environments, such as controlled field and laboratory conditions. In these two procedures, the laboratory spectra give clear, diagnostic spectral information in the present study. Reflectance spectra captured under 350-2500 nm covering UV, Visible, NIR, and SWIR part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The spectral characteristics of anorthosites measured under various parts of electromagnetic spectrum have diagnostic absorption features at 380-387, 700-740, 930-1100, 1160-1200, 1415, 1920, 2200 and 2330 nm correspondingly due to plagioclase UV absorption, Fe(3+) electron transition absorption, Fe(2+) pyroxene and olivine absorption, OH/Mn(3+) crystal transition absorption, pyroxene absorption, Al-OH absorption and Mg-OH absorption. Mineralogical and chemical analyses were carried out for four anorthosites and compared with the results of chemical component of lunar anorthosite. The percentage of plagioclase content, relative abundance of low and high calcium pyroxene and olivine in different anorthosite samples are correlated with the albedo range, absorption shape, absorption centers and band depth. The similarity in the diagnostic spectral features of the anolog anorthosite with lunar anorthosites could be effectively utilized for remotely mapping the lunar highland region.

By first filtering the data by Simple Exponential Smoothing, we have applied the periodogram method to the processed data in order to search for its time variation. The study exhibits multi-periodicities on these data around 110, 118, 574 and 740 d with very high confidence levels (more than 99%). These periods are significantly similar to the periods of other solar activities which may suggest that solar irradiance may be associated with other solar activities.

AB The observed linear polarization data of comet Hyakutake are studied at wavelengths lambda = 0.365 mu m, lambda = 0.485 mu m and 0.684 mu m through simulations using Ballistic Particle-Cluster Aggregate and Ballistic Cluster-Cluster Aggregate aggregates of 128 spherical monomers. We first found that the size parameter of the monomer, x similar to 1.56 - 1.70, turned out to be the most suitable which provides the best fits to the observed dust scattering properties at three wavelengths: lambda = 0.365 mu m, 0.485 mu m and 0.684 mu m. Thus, the effective radius of the aggregate (r) lies in the range 0.45 mu m <= r <= 0.49 mu m at lambda = 0.365 mu m; 0.60 mu m <= r <= 0.66 mu m at lambda = 0.485 mu m and 0.88 mu m <= r <= 0.94 mu m at lambda = 0.684 mu m. Now using superposition T-MATRIX code and the power-law size distribution, n(r) similar to r(-3), the best-fitting values of complex refractive indices are calculated for the observed polarization data at the above three wavelengths. The best-fitting complex refractive indices (n, k) are found to be (1.745, 0.095) at lambda = 0.365 mu m, (1.743, 0.100) at lambda = 0.485 mu m and (1.695, 0.100) at lambda = 0.684 mu m. The refractive indices derived from the present analysis correspond to a mixture of both silicates and organics, which are in good agreement with the in situ measurement of comets by different spacecraft.

AB We present a technique for automatic determination of flare ribbon separation and the energy released during the course of two-ribbon flares. We have used chromospheric H alpha filtergrams and photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms to analyse flare ribbon separation and magnetic field structures, respectively. Flare ribbons were first enhanced and then extracted by the technique of "region growing", i.e., a morphological operator to help resolve the flare ribbons. Separation of flare ribbons was then estimated from the magnetic-polarity reversal line using an automatic technique implemented into an Interactive Data Language (IDLTM) platform. Finally, the rate of flare-energy release was calculated using photospheric magnetic field data and the corresponding separation of the chromospheric H alpha flare ribbons. This method could be applied to measure the motion of any feature of interest (e.g., intensity, magnetic, Doppler) from a given point of reference.

Pre-processing of H alpha images includes corrections for limb darkening and foreshortening. Further, by applying suitable intensity and size thresholds, filaments are extracted, while other solar features, e.g. sunspots and plages, are removed. Filament attributes such as their position on the solar disc, total area, length, and number of fragments are determined. In addition, every filament is also labelled with a unique number for identification. The algorithm is capable of following a particular filament through successive images, which allows us to detect their changes and disappearance. We have analysed ten cases of filament eruption from different observatories, and the results obtained are presented. The algorithm will eventually be integrated with an upcoming telescope at the Udaipur Solar Observatory for real-time monitoring of activated/eruptive filaments. This aspect should prove to be of particular importance in studies pertaining to space weather.

AB The STEREO mission has been providing a stereoscopic view of filament eruptions in the EUV. The clearest view during a filament eruption is seen in He ii 304 observations. One of the main problems in visualizing filament dynamics in He ii 304 is the strong background contrast due to surface features. We present a technique that removes background features and leaves behind only the filamentary structure, as seen by STEREO-A and -B. The technique uses a pair of STEREO He ii 304 images observed simultaneously. The STEREO-B image is geometrically transformed to a STEREO-A view so that the background images appear similar. Filaments, being elevated structures, i.e., not lying on the same spherical surface as background features, do not appear similar in the transformed view. Thus, subtracting the two images cancels the background but leaves behind the filament structure. We apply this technique to study the dynamics of the filament-eruption event of 22 May 2008, which was observed by STEREO and followed by several ground-based observatories participating in the Joint Observing Programme (JOP 178).

AB The entropy-area spectrum of a black hole has been a long-standing and unsolved problem. Based on a recent methodology introduced by two of the authors, for the black hole radiation (Hawking effect) as tunneling effect, we obtain the entropy spectrum of a black hole. In Einstein's gravity, we show that both entropy and area spectrum are evenly spaced. But in more general theories (like Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity), although the entropy spectrum is equispaced, the corresponding area spectrum is not. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the results of our observations of H i absorption towards the central region of the rejuvenated radio galaxy 4C29.30 (J0840+2949) with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The radio source has diffuse, extended emission with an angular size of similar to 520 arcsec (639 kpc) within which a compact edge-brightened double-lobed source with a size of 29 arcsec (36 kpc) is embedded. The absorption profile which is seen towards the central component of the inner double is well resolved and consists of six components; all but one of which appears to be redshifted relative to the optical systemic velocity. The neutral hydrogen column density is estimated to be N(H i) = 4.7 x 1021(T(s)/100)(f(c)/1.0) cm-2, where T(s) and f(c) are the spin temperature and covering factor of the background source, respectively. This detection reinforces a strong correlation between the occurrence of H i absorption and rejuvenation of radio activity suggested earlier, with the possibility that the redshifted gas is fuelling the recent activity.

AB We present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope H i observations of two extremely metal-deficient (XMD) galaxies, UM 133 and SDSS J011914.27-093546.4, with no known nearby companions. Earlier H i observations of XMD galaxies have shown that disturbed H i morphologies and kinematics, generally related to tidal interaction with a companion, are common in them. However, some of these galaxies were already known to be in pairs before the H i observations. The two galaxies studied here were specifically selected because they do not have any known nearby companions. None the less, we find that both the galaxies have highly disturbed H i morphologies and velocity fields. These could have arisen from interactions with more distant companions than considered in our isolation criteria or merger with extremely gas-rich dwarf companions. It is also possible that distorted H i distributions of these XMD galaxies are the result of cold gas accretion from the intergalactic medium. Our observations provide further support to the idea that inflow of metal-poor gas from the outskirts of a galaxy to the central star-forming regions (in the case of interaction), or cold gas accretion is the probable cause for the observed low emission-line metallicities of XMD galaxies.

ID STANDING SHOCKS; DISKS
AB We study the accretion processes on a black hole by a numerical simulation. We use a grid-based finite difference code for this purpose. We scan the parameter space spanned by the specific energy and the angular momentum and compare the time-dependent solutions with those obtained from theoretical considerations. We found several important results. (a) The time-dependent flow behaves close to a constant height model flow in the pre-shock region and a flow with vertical equilibrium in the post-shock region. (c) The infall time-scale in the post-shock region is several times higher than the free-fall time-scale. (b) There are two discontinuities in the flow, one being just outside of the inner sonic point. Turbulence plays a major role in determining the locations of these discontinuities. (d) The two discontinuities oscillate with two different frequencies and behave as a coupled harmonic oscillator. A Fourier analysis of the variation of the outer shock location indicates higher power at the lower frequency and lower power at the higher frequency. The opposite is true when the analysis of the inner shock is made. These behaviours will have implications in the spectral and timing properties of black hole candidates.

AB Assuming that metric type II radio bursts from the Sun are due to magnetohydrodynamic shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we estimate the average CME acceleration from its source region up to the position of the type II burst. The acceleration values are in the range approximate to 600-1240 m s(-2), which are consistent with values obtained using non-radio methods. We also find that (1) CMEs with comparatively larger acceleration in the low corona are associated with soft X-ray flares of higher energy; the typical acceleration of a CME associated with X1.0 class soft X-ray flare being approximate to 1020 m s(-2), and (2) CMEs with comparatively higher speed in the low corona slow down quickly at large distances from the Sun-the deceleration of a CME with a typical speed of 1000 km s(-1) being approximate to-15 m s(-2) in the distance range of approximate to 3-32 R-circle dot.

AB Recent studies have indicated that the occurrence of the maxima of coronal mass ejection (CME) rate and sunspot number (SSN) were nearly two years apart. We find that the two-year lag of CME rate manifests only when the SSN index is considered and the lag is minimal (two-three months) when the sunspot area is considered. CMEs with speeds greater than the average speed follow the sunspot cycle much better than the entire population of CMEs. Analysis of the linear speeds of CMEs further indicates that during the descending phase of the solar cycle the loss of magnetic flux is through more frequent and less energetic CMEs. We emphasize that the magnetic field attaining the nonpotentiality that represents the free energy content, rather than the flux content as measured by the area of the active region, plays an important role in producing CMEs.

AB We report on the detection of strong circularly polarized emission from the transient bursting source GCRT J1745-3009 based on new analysis of 325 MHz Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations conducted on 2003 September 28. We place 8 R(circle dot) as the upper limit on the size of the emission region. The implied high brightness temperature required for an object beyond 1 pc and the high fraction of circular polarization firmly establish the emission as coherent. Electron cyclotron or plasma emission from a highly subsolar magnetically dominated dwarf located <= 4 kpc away could have given rise to the GCRT radio emission.

AB The penetration of magnetospheric electric fields to the magnetic equator has been investigated for two intense magnetic storms that occurred on 31 March 2001 and 6 November 2001. The digital ground magnetic data from equatorial station Tirunelveli (TIR, 0.17 degrees S geomagnetic latitude (GML)) and low-latitude station Alibag (ABG, 10.17 degrees N GML) have been used to identify the storm time electrojet index, EEJ(Dis), which is the difference of the magnetic field variations between TIR and ABG after removing the quiet day variations. The appearance of enhanced DP 2 currents and counterelectrojets (CEJ) during the main and recovery phases of the magnetic storms is possibly due to prompt penetration of electric fields from the high latitudes. These signatures can be interpreted as a clear indicator of the eastward and westward electric fields at the equator. The observed results suggest that the magnitude of the equatorial ionospheric currents driven by the penetrating electric fields is very sensitive to ionospheric conductivity (which depends on local time). Moreover, the intensity of the DP 2 currents started decreasing during the end of the main phase of the storm despite the large negative southward IMF Bz, indicating the dominance of a well-developed shielding electric field for 1 h. As an effect of penetrating electric fields at the equator, the equatorial ionization anomaly is enhanced during the main phase (because of strong eastward electric field) and is inhibited or reduced due to the strong CEJ (because of westward electric field) during the recovery phase.

AB The purpose of this paper is to describe some unusual whistlers (doublets and triplets) and VLF hiss emission recorded simultaneously on February 18, 1998 during nighttime at a low latitude Indian ground station Jammu (geomag. lat., 22 degrees 26' N; L = 1.17), and to make some discussions about their origin. The detailed structures of the observed VLF hiss emission clearly show that these emissions confined to a narrow continuous frequency band. Some times the frequency of hiss band oscillates and subsequently touches the upper edge of the first whistler component of the doublet. Detailed structures of the dynamic spectra of whistler and VLF hiss emission are briefly presented. From the dispersion analysis of the whistler doublets and triplets, it is found that the individual whistlers of the doublets and triplets simultaneously observed on the same day are one-hop whistlers having propagation path along higher and closely spaced L-values. Our result also shows that VLF hiss has been generated in the equatorial region of higher L-values. Generation and propagation mechanisms are briefly discussed. (C) 2009 COSPAR.

AB We consider here a spherically symmetric but inhomogeneous universe filled with a massless scalar field. The model obeys two constraints. The first one is that the gradient of the scalar field is timelike everywhere. The second constraint is that the radial coordinate basis vector is a unit vector field in the comoving coordinate system. We find that the resultant dynamical solutions compose a one-parameter family of self-similar models which is known as the Roberts solution. The solutions are divided into three classes. The first class consists of solutions with only one spacelike singularity in the synchronous-comoving chart. The second class consists of solutions with two singularities which are null and spacelike, respectively. The third class consists of solutions with two spacelike singularities which correspond to the big bang and big crunch, respectively. We see that, in the first case, a comoving volume exponentially expands as in an inflationary period; the fluid elements are accelerated outwards from the symmetry center, even though the strong energy condition is satisfied. This behavior is very different from that observed in the homogeneous and isotropic universe in which the fluid elements would move outwards with deceleration, if the strong energy conditions are satisfied. We are thus able to achieve the accelerated expansion of the universe for the models considered here, without a need to violate the energy conditions. The cosmological features of the models are examined in some detail.

AB We continue exploring free strings in the background of null Kasner-like cosmological singularities, following K. Narayan, arXiv:0904.4532. We study the free string Schrodinger wave functional along the lines of K. Narayan, arXiv:0807.1517. We find the wave functional to be nonsingular in the vicinity of singularities whose Kasner exponents satisfy certain relations. We compare this with the description in other variables. We then study certain regulated versions of these singularities where the singular region is replaced by a substringy but nonsingular region and study the string spectra in these backgrounds. The string modes can again be solved for exactly, giving some insight into how string oscillator states get excited near the singularity.

AB Hawking radiation from the black hole in Horava-Lifshitz gravity IS discussed by a reformulation of the tunneling method given in Banerjee and Majhi (2009) [17]. Using a density matrix technique the radiation spectrum is derived which is identical to that of a perfect black body The temperature obtained here is proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole as occurs in usual Einstein gravity The entropy is also derived by using the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Finally. the spectrum of entropy/area is obtained The later result is also discussed from the viewpoint of quasi-normal modes Both methods lead to an equispaced entropy spectrum, although the Value of the spacing is not the same Oil the other hand. since the entropy is not proportional to the horizon area of the black hole, the area spectrum IS not equidistant, a finding which also holds for the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

We also discuss how the obtained open-string/matter moduli make it easier to impose FCNC constraints, as well as RG flow of off-diagonal squark mass(-squared) matrix elements (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

TI Searching for galactic white-dwarf binaries in mock LISA data using an
   F-statistic template bank
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
LA English
DT Article
ID DATA CHALLENGES
AB We describe an F-statistic search for continuous gravitational waves from galactic white-dwarf binaries in simulated LISA data. Our search method employs a hierarchical template-grid-based exploration of the parameter space. In the first stage, candidate sources are identified in searches using different simulated laser signal combinations (known as TDI variables). Since each source generates a primary maximum near its true 'Doppler parameters' (intrinsic frequency and sky position) as well as numerous secondary maxima of the F-statistic in Doppler parameter space, a search for multiple sources needs to distinguish between true signals and secondary maxima associated with other 'louder' signals. Our method does this by applying a coincidence test to reject candidates which are not found at nearby parameter space positions in searches using each of the three TDI variables. For signals surviving the coincidence test, we perform a fully coherent search over a refined parameter grid to provide an accurate parameter estimation for the final candidates. Suitably tuned, the pipeline is able to extract 1989 true signals with only 5 false alarms. The use of the rigid adiabatic approximation allows recovery of signal parameters with errors comparable to statistical expectations, although there is still some systematic excess with respect to statistical errors expected from Gaussian noise. An experimental iterative pipeline with seven rounds of signal subtraction and reanalysis of the residuals allows us to increase the number of signals recovered to a total of 3419 with 29 false alarms.

AB In the conventional seesaw models of neutrino masses, leptogenesis occurs at a very high scale. Three approaches have been discussed in the literature to lower the scale of leptogenes is making them testable: mass degeneracy, hierarchy of couplings and three body decays. We advocate yet another approach to a testable leptogenesis, where by the decaying particles could go out of equilibrium at an accessibles scale due to kinematics, although their couplings to the decay products are larger for generating a desired CP asymmetry. We demonstrate this new possibility for the testable leptogenes is in a two Higgs doublet model where the neutrino masses originate from a one-loop diagram.

AB The major problem in the cosmological nucleosynthesis is the evaluation of the reaction rate. The present scenario is that the standard thermonuclear function in the Maxwell-Boltzmann form is evaluated by using various techniques. The Maxwell-Boltzmannian approach to nuclear reaction rate theory is extended to cover Tsallis statistics (Tsallis, 1988) and more general cases of distribution functions. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate in some more detail the extended reaction probability integral in the equilibrium thermodynamic argument and in the cut-off case. The extended reaction probability integrals will be evaluated in closed form for all convenient values of the parameter by means of residue calculus. A comparison of the standard reaction probability integrals with the extended reaction probability integrals is also done. (C) 2009 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed a new procedure to search for carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars from the Hamburg/ESO (HES) prism-survey plates. This method employs an extended line index for the CH G band, which we demonstrate to have superior performance when compared to the narrower G-band index formerly employed to estimate G-band strengths for these spectra. Although CEMP stars have been found previously among candidate metal-poor stars selected from the HES, the selection on metallicity undersamples the population of intermediate-metallicity CEMP stars (-2.5 <= [Fe/H] <= -1.0); such stars are of importance for constraining the onset of the s-process in metal-deficient asymptotic giant branch stars (thought to be associated with the origin of carbon for roughly 80% of CEMP stars). The new candidates also include substantial numbers of warmer carbon-enhanced stars, which were missed in previous HES searches for carbon stars due to selection criteria that emphasized cooler stars. A first subsample, biased toward brighter stars (B < 15.5), has been extracted from the scanned HES plates. After visual inspection (to eliminate spectra compromised by plate defects, overlapping spectra, etc., and to carry out rough spectral classifications), a list of 669 previously unidentified candidate CEMP stars was compiled. Follow-up spectroscopy for a pilot sample of 132 candidates was obtained with the Goodman spectrograph on the SOAR 4.1 m telescope. Our results show that most of the observed stars lie in the targeted metallicity range, and possess prominent carbon absorption features at 4300 angstrom. The success rate for the identification of new CEMP stars is 43% (13 out of 30) for [Fe/H] < -2.0. For stars with [Fe/H] < -2.5, the ratio increases to 80% (four out of five objects), including one star with [Fe/H] < -3.0.

AB Context. Cepheids are the primary distance indicators for the external galaxies, so discovery of large number of Cepheid variables in far-off galaxies offers a unique opportunity to determine the accurate distance of the host galaxy through their period-luminosity relation.
   Aims. The main purpose of this study is to identify short-period and relatively faint Cepheids in the crowded field of M31 disk, which was observed as part of the Nainital Microlensing Survey.
   Methods. The Cousins R and I band photometric observations were carried out in the direction of M31 with the aim of detecting microlensing events. The data was obtained with a 1-m telescope on more than 150 nights over the period between November 1998 and January 2002. The data was analysed using the pixel technique and the mean magnitudes of the Cepheids were determined by correlating their pixel fluxes with the corresponding PSF-fitted photometric magnitudes.
   Results. In the present study we report identification of short-period Cepheid variables in the M31 disk. We present a catalogue of 39 short-period (P < 15 days) Cepheids in a similar to 13 x 13' region of the M31 disk and give positions and pulsation periods along with heir R and I bands photometric magnitudes wherever possible. Most of the Cepheids are found with R (mean) similar to 20-21 mag, and the dense phase coverage of our observations enabled us to identify Cepheids with periods as short as 3.4 days. The period distribution of these Cepheids peaks at log P similar to 0.9 and 1.1 days.
   Conclusions. We demonstrate that using the pixel method, faint and short-period Cepheids in M31 can even be detected with small-size telescopes and moderate observing conditions.

AB The absence of a well established point Source of very high energy ( greater than or similar to 10 TeV) gamma-rays in the sky, makes the measurement of the angular resolution and the absolute pointing accuracy of an extensive air shower (EAS) array a challenging task. In the past, several groups have utilized the reduction in the isotropic flux of cosmic rays due to the shadows of the Moon and the Sun, to measure the angular resolution and the absolute pointing accuracy of their arrays. The data collected from the GRAPES-3 EAS array, over the period of 4 years from 2000 to 2003, has been used to observe the shadow of the Moon at a level of similar to 5 sigma and that of the Sun at a lower level of significance. The high density of the detectors in GRAPES-3 enabled an angular resolution of 0.7 degrees to be obtained at energies as low as 30 TeV. The angular resolution Studies were further extended by using two other techniques, namely, the even-odd and the left-right methods. All three techniques have yielded nearly identical results on the energy dependent angular resolution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present infrared JHK photometry of the cataclysmic variable (CV) SDSS J123813.73-033933.0 and analyze it along with optical spectroscopy, demonstrating that the binary system is most probably comprised of a massive white dwarf with T(eff) = 12000 +/- 1000 K and a brown dwarf of spectral type L4. The inferred system parameters suggest that this system may have evolved beyond the orbital period minimum and is a bounce-back system. SDSS J123813.73-033933.0 stands out among CVs by exhibiting the cyclical variability that Zharikov et al. called brightenings. These are not related to specific orbital phases of the binary system and are fainter than dwarf novae outbursts that usually occur on longer timescales. This phenomenon has not been observed extensively and, thus, is poorly understood. The new time-resolved, multi-longitude photometric observations of SDSS J123813.73-033933.0 allowed us to observe two consecutive brightenings and to determine their recurrence time. The period analysis of all observed brightenings during 2007 suggests a typical timescale that is close to a period of similar to 9.3 hr. However, the brightenings modulation is not strictly periodic, possibly maintaining coherence only on timescales of several weeks. The characteristic variability with double orbital frequency that clearly shows up during brightenings is also analyzed. The Doppler mapping of the system shows the permanent presence of a spiral arm pattern in the accretion disk. A simple model is presented to demonstrate that spiral arms in the velocity map appear at the location and phase corresponding to the 2: 1 resonance radius and constitute themselves as double-humped light curves. The long-term and short-term variability of this CV is discussed together with the spiral arm structure of an accretion disk in the context of observational effects taking place in bounce-back systems.

AB Recently, Karoff & Kjeldsen presented evidence of strong correlation between the energy in the high-frequency part (5.3 < nu < 8.3 mHz) of the acoustic spectrum of the Sun and the solar X-ray flux. They have used disk-integrated intensity observations of the Sun obtained from the Variability of solar IRradiance and Gravity Oscillations instrument on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft. Similar signature of flares in velocity observations has not been confirmed till now. The study of low-degree high-frequency waves in the Sun is important for our understanding of the dynamics of the deeper solar layers. In this Letter, we present the analysis of the velocity observations of the Sun obtained from the Michelson and Doppler Imager (MDI) and the Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies (GOLF) instruments on board SOHO for some major flare events of the solar cycle 23. Application of wavelet techniques to the time series of disk-integrated velocity signals from the solar surface using the full-disk Dopplergrams obtained from the MDI clearly indicates that there is enhancement of high-frequency global waves in the Sun during the flares. This signature of flares is also visible in the Fourier Power Spectrum of these velocity oscillations. On the other hand, the analysis of disk-integrated velocity observations obtained from the GOLF shows only marginal evidence of effects of flares on high-frequency oscillations.

AB By adopting the Newman-Penrose-Jogia-Griffith formalism, the field equations in Einstein-Cartan theory for matter with spin creating torsion in space-time are solved in a spherically symmetric space-time by assuming only one non-vanishing component of spin. The exact solution might be the prototype for more realistic models.

AB Static and spherical symmetric solutions of the field equations in the bimetric general theory of gravitation are obtained for perfect and anisotropic charged fluids under the assumption that the physical metric admits a one-parameter group of conformal motion. All solutions are matched to the Reissner-Nordstrom metric and possess positive energy density larger than the stresses, everywhere within the sphere. The solution agrees with Einstein's general relativity for a physical system comparable to the size of the universe, such as the solar system.

In both cases we find the expressions of the chameleon field, chameleon potential, statefinder parameters, and slow-roll parameters. Also, it has been shown that the potential always decreases with the chameleon field in both scenarios. The nature of the slow-roll parameters has been shown diagrammatically.

AB In radiative transfer, the intensities of radiation from the bounding faces of a scattering atmosphere of finite optical thickness can be expressed in terms of Chandrasekhar's X- and Y-functions. The nonlinear nonhomogeneous coupled integral equations which the X- and Y-functions satisfy in the real plane are meromorphically extended to the complex plane to frame linear nonhomogeneous coupled singular integral equations. These singular integral equations are then transformed into nonhomogeneous Riemann-Hilbert problems using Plemelj's formulae. Solutions of those Riemann-Hilbert problems are obtained using the theory of linear singular integral equations. New forms of linear nonhomogeneous decoupled expressions are derived for X- and Y-functions in the complex plane and real plane. Solutions of these two expressions are obtained in terms of one known N-function and two new unknown functions N (1)- and N (2)- in the complex plane for both nonconservative and conservative cases. The N (1)- and N (2)-functions are expressed in terms of the known N-function using the theory of contour integration. The unknown constants are derived from the solutions of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind uniquely using the new linear decoupled constraints. The expressions for the H-function for a semi-infinite atmosphere are obtained as a limiting case.

AB We present the spectroscopic study of 5 Herbig Ae/Be stars in young open clusters. These are identified from a survey of emission-line stars in young open clusters. The Herbig Ae/Be stars are found to show a linear correlation in H(alpha) equivalent width versus reddening corrected (H-K(s)) colour plot, with a clear offset from the distribution of Classical Be stars. The candidates are found to show near infrared excess which was revealed through de-reddened (J-H) versus (H-K(s)) colour-colour diagram and spectral energy distribution. From optical/near-IR photometry and spectroscopy, we suggest that Bochum 6-1, IC 1590-1 and NGC 6823-1 are Herbig Be while IC 1590-2 and NGC 7380-4 are Herbig Ae candidates. Bochum 6-1 is an interesting Herbig B[e) star with a high H(alpha) equivalent width of -206 angstrom, which is the highest among the surveyed stars. We combined the optical and near-IR photometry to estimate the duration of star formation in the clusters, Bochum 6, IC 1590, NGC 6823 and NGC 7380. We found ongoing star formation in all these clusters, with an appreciable number of pre-main sequence stars. The age of these Herbig Ac/Be stars, estimated using pre-main sequence isochrones, were found to range between 0.25-3 Myr. IC 1590 is found to be an interesting young cluster (similar to 4 Myr) with 3 emission stars, each belonging to Herbig Ac, Herbig Be and Classical Be respectively. All the four clusters studied here were found to be forming stars for the last 10 Myr.

AB We model the binary black hole system OJ287 as a spinning primary and a non-spinning secondary. It is assumed that the primary has an accretion disk which is impacted by the secondary at specific times. These times are identified as major outbursts in the light curve of OJ287. This identification allows an exact solution of the orbit, with very tight error limits. Nine outbursts from both the historical photographic records as well as from recent photometric measurements have been used as fixed points of the solution: 1913, 1947, 1957, 1973, 1983, 1984, 1995, 2005 and 2007 outbursts. This allows the determination of eight parameters of the orbit. Most interesting of these are the primary mass of 1.84.10(10) M(circle dot), the secondary mass 1.40.10(8) M(circle dot), major axis precession rate 39 degrees.1 per period, and the eccentricity of the orbit 0.70. The dimensionless spin parameter is 0.28 +/- 0.01 (1 sigma). The last parameter will be more tightly constrained in 2015 when the next outburst is due. The outburst should begin on 15 December 2015 if the spin value is in the middle of this range, on 3 January 2016 if the spin is 0.25, and on 26 November 2015 if the spin is 0.31. We have also tested the possibility that the quadrupole term in the post-Newtonian equations of motion does not exactly follow Einstein's theory: a parameter q is introduced as one of the 8 parameters. Its value is within 30% (1 sigma) of the Einstein's value q = 1. This supports the no-hair theorem of black holes within the achievable precision. We have also measured the loss of orbital energy due to gravitational waves. The loss rate is found to agree with Einstein's value with the accuracy of 2% (1 sigma). There is a possibility of improving the accuracy of both quantities using the exact timing of the outburst on 21 July 2019. Because of closeness of OJ287 to the Sun (8-12 degrees), the observations would be best carried out by a telescope in space.

AB Following Einstein's definition of Lagrangian density and gravitational field energy density ( Einstein in Ann Phys Lpz 49: 806, 1916, Einstein in PhysZ19:115, 1918, Pauli in Theory of Relativity, B. I. Publications, Mumbai, 1963), Tolman derived a general formula for the total matter plus gravitational field energy (P(0)) of an arbitrary system ( Tolman in Phys Rev 35: 875, 1930, Tolman in Relativity, Thermodynamics & Cosmology, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1962, Xulu in hep-th/0308070, 2003). For a static isolated system, in quasi-Cartesian coordinates, this formula leads to the well known result P(0) = integral root-g(T(0)(0) - T(1)(1) - T(2)(2) - T(3)(3))d(3)x, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor and T(b)(a) is the energy momentum tensor of the matter. Though in the literature, this is known as "Tolman Mass", it must be realized that this is essentially "Einstein Mass" because the underlying pseudo-tensor here is due to Einstein. In fact, Landau-Lifshitz obtained the same expression for the "inertial mass" of a static isolated system without using any pseudo-tensor at all and which points to physical significance and correctness of Einstein Mass ( Landau, Lifshitz in The Classical Theory of Fields, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1962)! For the first time we apply this general formula to find an expression for P(0) for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric by using the same quasi-Cartesian basis. As we analyze this new result, it transpires that, physically, a spatially flat model having no cosmological constant is preferred. Eventually, it is seen that conservation of P(0) is honoured only in the static limit.

AB We considered an anisotropic brane embedded in a five-dimensional bulk space-time. The Einstein equations and Friedmann equations are obtained. The corresponding Friedmann equations are modified with quadratic corrections to energy density. The anisotropic DGP model also admits a self-accelerating phase in the late universe. The acceleration conditions are obtained and they are consistent with the braneworld scenario. The acceleration condition for DGP model, in the late universe, is dependent on the crossover scale r(c).

AB Interstellar extinction curves obtained from the 'extinction without standard' method were used to constrain the dust characteristics in the mean ISM (R(V) = 3.1), along the lines of sight through a high latitude diffuse molecular cloud towards HD 210121 (R(V) = 2.1) and in a dense interstellar environment towards the cluster NGC 1977 (R(V) = 6.42). We have used three-component dust models comprising silicate, graphite and very small carbonaceous grains (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) following the grain size distributions introduced by Li & Draine in 2001. It is shown that oxygen, carbon and silicon abundances derived from our models are closer with the available elemental abundances for the dust grains in the ISM if F & G type stars atmospheric abundances are taken for the ISM than the solar. The importance of very small grains in modelling the variation of interstellar extinction curves has been investigated. Grain size distributions and elemental abundances locked up in dust are studied and compared at different interstellar environments using these three extinction curves. We present the albedo and the scattering asymmetry parameter evaluated from optical to extreme-UV wavelengths for the proposed dust models.

AB We have made spectral line analysis of CO and its isotopic lines from dark cloud Lynds 183 (L183). Our dataset incorporates (12)CO(1-0), (13)CO(1-0) and (13)CO(2-1) lines using NRAO-12 m and (12)CO(3-2), (13)CO(3-2) lines using CSO-10 m telescopes, respectively. Observations suggest steep north-south (direction with respect to the offset position (0, 0)) temperature gradient in the cloud. These are likely to be caused by non-uniform, Inter Stellar Radiation Field (ISRF) illumination due to the shadow of nearby L134 cloud complex. As the emission of radiation depends on local properties like density and kinetic temperature, the present study attempts to deduce the irradiation contrast (and the resulting temperature difference) using 1D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RATRAN. The model results accord with the observed data and shows a temperature difference of similar to 7 K mainly within the cloud envelope. This results in a non-uniform intensity distribution of both CO and its species.

AB W51 is a giant radio complex lying along the tangent to the Sagitarius arm at a distance of about 7 kpc from the Sun, with an extension of about 1 degrees in the sky. It is divided into three components A, B, C where W51A and W51B consist of many compact Hill regions while W51C is a supernova remnant. We have made continuum radio observations of these HIE regions of the W51 complex at 240, 610, 1060 and 1400 MHz using GMRT with lower resolution (20 '' x 15 '') at the lowest frequency. The observed spectra of the prominent thermal subcomponents of W51 have been fitted to a free-free emission spectrum and their physical properties like electron temperatures and emission measures have been estimated. The electron temperatures from continuum spectra are found to be lower than the temperatures reported from radio recombination line (RRL) studies of these Hill regions indicating the need for a filling factor even at this resolution. Also, the observed brightness at 240 MHz is found to be higher than expected from the best fits suggesting the need for a multicomponent model for the region.

AB We study second-order perturbations for a general non-canonical scalar field, minimally coupled to gravity, on the unperturbed FRW background, where metric fluctuations are neglected a priori. By employing different approaches to cosmological perturbation theory, we show that, even in this simplified set-up, the second-order perturbations to the stress tensor, the energy density and the pressure display potential instabilities, which are riot present at linear order. The conditions on the Lagrangian under which these instabilities take place are provided. We also discuss briefly the significance of our analysis in light of the possible linearization instability of these fields about the FRW background.

AB Using data from observations made with XMM-Newton, we present an X-ray analysis of two Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries: V444 Cyg and CD Cru. The X-ray light curves show the phase-locked variability in both binaries, where the flux increased by a factor of similar to 2 for V444 Cyg and similar to 1.5 for CD Cru, from minimum to maximum. The maximum luminosities in the 0.3-7.5 keV energy band were found to be 5.8 x 1032 and 2.8 x 1032 erg s-1 for V444 Cyg and CD Cru, respectively. The X-ray spectra of these stars confirmed large extinction and revealed hot plasma with prominent emission-line features of highly ionized Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe; these are found to be consistent with a two-temperature plasma model. At a temperature of similar to 0.6 keV, the cooler plasma was found to be constant at all phases for both binaries, which could be the result of a distribution of small-scale shocks in radiation-driven outflows. The hot components in these binaries were found to be phase-dependent. They varied from 1.85 to 9.61 keV for V444 Cyg and from 1.63 to 4.27 keV for CD Cru. The absorption of the hard component varied with the orbital phase and was found to be maximum during the primary eclipse of V444 Cyg. The high plasma temperature and variability with orbital phase suggest that the hard-component emission is caused by a colliding wind shock between the binary components.

The X-ray properties of these systems suggest that they are likely members of persistent high-mass X-ray binaries or intermediate polars (IPs). Using our Chandra observations, we detected the most likely counterparts of three sources (excluding AX J1820.5-1434 and AX J1832.3-0840) in their European Southern Observatory-New Technology Telescope (ESO-NTT) NIR observations, and a possible counterpart for AX J1820.5-1434 and AX J1832.3-0840 in the Two Micron All Sky Survey and Digitized Sky Survey observations, respectively. We also performed the X-ray timing and spectral analysis for all the sources using our XMM-Newton observations, which further helped us to constrain the nature of these systems. Our multiwavelength observations suggest that AX J1749.2-2725 and AX J1820.5-1434 most likely harbour accreting neutron stars, while AX J1700.1-4157, AX J1740.1-2847 and AX J1832.3-0840 could be IPs.

AB We present the full source catalogue from the Australia Telescope 20 GHz (AT20G) Survey. The AT20G is a blind radio survey carried out at 20 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) from 2004 to 2008, and covers the whole sky south of declination 0 degrees. The AT20G source catalogue presented here is an order of magnitude larger than any previous catalogue of high-frequency radio sources, and includes 5890 sources above a 20 GHz flux-density limit of 40 mJy. All AT20G sources have total intensity and polarization measured at 20 GHz, and most sources south of declination -15 degrees also have near-simultaneous flux-density measurements at 5 and 8 GHz. A total of 1559 sources were detected in polarized total intensity at one or more of the three frequencies.
   The completeness of the AT20G source catalogue is 91 per cent above 100 mJy beam(-1) and 79 per cent above 50 mJy beam(-1) in regions south of declination -15 degrees. North of -15 degrees, some observations of sources between 14 and 20 h in right ascension were lost due to bad weather and could not be repeated, so the catalogue completeness is lower in this region. Each detected source was visually inspected as part of our quality control process, and so the reliability of the final catalogue is essentially 100 per cent.
   We detect a small but significant population of non-thermal sources that are either undetected or have only weak detections in low-frequency catalogues. We introduce the term Ultra-Inverted Spectrum to describe these radio sources, which have a spectral index alpha(5, 20) > +0.7 and which constitute roughly 1.2 per cent of the AT20G sample.
   The 20 GHz flux densities measured for the strongest AT20G sources are in excellent agreement with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5-year source catalogue of Wright et al., and we find that the WMAP source catalogue is close to complete for sources stronger than 1.5 Jy at 23 GHz.

AB We present Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) mid-infrared photometry on the massive star-forming region AFGL 437 (IRAS 03035+5819). From the IRAC colour-colour diagram, we identify several new embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) within 64 arcsec of the central compact cluster. Using the IRAC ratio images, we investigate the molecular outflows associated with the highly embedded YSO WK34 in the central cluster. We attribute the lobes seen (extended to similar to 0.16 pc in the north) in the ratio map to shocked molecular hydrogen emission. IRAC images reveal a large diffuse nebulosity associated with the central cluster and extending up to similar to 8.0 pc from south-west to north-east direction with its brightness gradually increasing from 3.6 to 8.0 mu m. A dense boxcar-shaped nebula (more than 2.0 pc in size) situated to the south-west of the cluster shows molecular hydrogen emission that may have been caused by shock waves from the compact cluster sources. It seems that these sources are also responsible for the infrared-bright nebulosity. Using a 2D radiative transfer model, we derive from the spectral energy distributions (SEDs), the mass, age and luminosity of all the YSOs identified within the central cluster. The SED modelling shows that the driving engine of the outflows, WK34, appears to be massive but very young and deeply embedded. The weighted mean values of the masses and ages of the 21 YSOs derived from the model are in the range 1-10M(circle dot) and 10(4.1-6.4) yr, respectively, while their luminosities are in the range of 10(0.47-3.48) L(circle dot).

AB Comet 17P/Holmes was observed for linear polarization using the optical polarimeter mounted on the 1.2-m telescope atop Gurushikhar peak near Mt. Abu during the period 2007 November-December. Observations were conducted through the International Halley Watch narrow-band (continuum) filters. During the observing run, the phase angle was near 13 degrees at which the comet showed negative polarization. On the basis of the observed polarization data, we find comet 17P/Holmes to be a typical comet with usual dust characteristics. We note that radial rate of change of brightness in coma in red band is higher than that in blue band; it has decreased by a factor of 3.6 and 2.5, respectively, in red and blue bands during the November-December run, indicating relative increase in the abundance of smaller dust particles outward. Radial brightness variation seen near the nucleus on November 6 is indicative of the presence of a blob or shocked region beyond 10 arcsec from the nucleus which has gradually smoothened by December 13. The brightness distribution is found steeper during November 5-7 as compared to that on December 13.

AB We study winds in high-redshift galaxies driven by a relativistic cosmic ray (proton) component in addition to the hot thermal gas component. Cosmic rays (CRs) are likely to be efficiently generated in supernova shocks inside galaxies. We obtain solutions of such CR-driven free winds in a gravitational potential of the Navarro-Frenk-White form, relevant to galaxies. CRs naturally provide the extra energy and/or momentum input to the system, needed for a transonic wind solution in a gas with adiabatic index gamma = 5/3. We show that CRs can effectively drive winds even when the thermal energy of the gas is lost due to radiative cooling. These wind solutions predict an asymptotic wind speed closely related to the circular velocity of the galaxy. Furthermore, the mass outflow rate per unit star formation rate (eta(w)) is predicted to be similar to 0.2-0.5 for massive galaxies, with masses M similar to 10(11)-10(12)M(circle dot). We show eta(w) to be inversely proportional to the square of the circular velocity. Magnetic fields at the mu G levels are also required in these galaxies to have a significant mass loss. A large eta(w) for small mass galaxies implies that CR-driven outflows could provide a strong negative feedback to the star formation in dwarf galaxies. Further, our results will also have important implications to the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. These conclusions are applicable to the class of free wind models where the source region is confined to be within the sonic point.

AB We present a radio survey carried out with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. A motivation for the survey was to make a complete inventory of the diffuse emission components as a step towards a study of the cosmic evolution in radio source structure and the contribution from radio-mode feedback on galaxy evolution. The Australia Telescope Low-Brightness Survey (ATLBS) at 1388 MHz covers 8.42 deg(2) of the sky in an observing mode designed to yield images with exceptional surface brightness sensitivity and low confusion. The survey was carried out in two adjacent regions on the sky centred at RA: 00(h)35(m)00(s), Dec.: -67 degrees 00'00 '' and RA: 00(h)59(m)17(s), Dec.: -67 degrees 00'00 '' (J2000.0). The ATLBS radio images, made with 0.08 mJy beam(-1) rms noise and 50 arcsec beam, detect a total of 1094 sources with peak flux exceeding 0.4 mJy beam(-1). The ATLBS source counts were corrected for blending, noise bias, resolution and primary beam attenuation; the normalized differential source counts are consistent with no upturn down to 0.6 mJy. The percentage integrated polarization Pi(0) was computed after corrections for the polarization bias in integrated polarized intensity; Pi(0) shows an increasing trend with decreasing flux density. Simultaneous visibility measurements made with longer baselines yielded images, with 5 arcsec beam, of compact components in sources detected in the survey. The observations provide a measurement of the complexity and diffuse emission associated with mJy and sub-mJy radio sources. 10 per cent of the ATLBS sources have more than half of their flux density in extended emission and the fractional flux in diffuse components does not appear to vary with flux density, although the percentage of sources that have complex structure increases with flux density. The observations are consistent with a transition in the nature of extended radio sources from FR-II radio source morphology, which dominates the mJy population, to FR-I structure at sub-mJy flux density.

AB We discuss two temperature accretion disk flows around rotating black holes. As we know that to explain observed hard X-rays the choice of Keplerian angular momentum profile is not unique, we consider the sub-Keplerian regime of the disk. Without any strict knowledge of the magnetic field structure, we assume the cooling mechanism is dominated by bremsstrahlung process. We show that in a range of Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter 0.2 greater than or similar to alpha greater than or similar to 0.0005, flow behavior varies widely, particularly by means of the size of disk, efficiency of cooling and corresponding temperatures of ions and electrons. We also show that the disk around a rotating black hole is hotter compared to that around a Schwarzschild black hole, rendering a larger difference between ion and electron temperatures in the former case. With all the theoretical solutions in hand, finally we reproduce the observed luminosities (L) of two extreme cases-the under-fed AGNs and quasars (e.g. Sgr A') with L greater than or similar to 10(33) erg/s to ultra-luminous X-ray sources with L similar to 10(41) erg/s, at different combinations of mass accretion rate, ratio of specific heats, Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter and Kerr parameter, and conclude that Sgr A' may be an intermediate spinning black hole.

AB Solar activity, such as flares and CMEs, affect the interplanetary medium, and Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, to understand the Space Weather, we need to understand the mechanisms of solar activity. Towards this end, we use 1135 events of solar H, flares and the positional data of sunspots from the archive of Solar Geophysical Data (SGD) for the period January-April, 2000 and compute the abnormal rotation rates that lead to high flare productivity. We report that the occurrence of 5 or more flares in a day in association with a given sunspot group can be defined as high flare productivity and the sunspots that have an abnormal rotation rates of similar to 4-10 deg day(-1) trigger high flare productivity. Further, in order to compare the flare productivity expressed as the strength of the flux emitted, especially the soft X-ray (SXR) flares in the frequency range of 1-8 angstrom, we compute the flare index of SXR flares and find that 8 out of 28 active regions used in this study satisfy the requirement for being flare productive. This enables us to conclude that the high rotation rates of sunspots are an important mechanism to understand the flare productivity, especially numerical flare productivity that includes flares of all class.

AB Absorption against the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), called the anomalous absorption, is an unusual phenomenon. The transition 1(11)-1(10) at 4.829 GHz of formaldehyde (H(2)CO) Was the first one showing the anomalous absorption. The c-C(3)H(2) is the second molecule showing anomalous absorption through its transition 2(20)-2(11), at 21.590 GHz. Structure of thioformaldehyde (H(2)CS) is very similar to that of the H(2)CO. Therefore we have investigated about the physical conditions under which the transition 1(11)-1(10) at 1.0465 GHz of H(2)CS would be found in anomalous absorption in cool cosmic objects. As in case of H(2)CO, the anomalous absorption of 1(11)-1(10) of H(2)CS is found sensitive to the relative collisional rates and it requires that the collisional rate for the transition 1(11)-2(11) must be smaller than that for the transition 1(10)-2(12).

AB Pulsars that have undergone a binary history have come to be known as "recycled pulsars". The very first binary pulsar to be discovered-the Hulse-Taylor pulsar-provided evidence for such a recycling. It is now widely accepted that the first-born neutron star dies a natural death as a pulsar due to its period lengthening. But eventually, it is spun back into life, once again, when it accretes matter and angular momentum from its companion. Such a spin up continues till the neutron star attains an "equilibrium period", which is determined by the strength of its magnetic field and the accretion rate. This article will attempt to give a historical perspective of how the various steps in the evolution of such a recycled neutron star were understood. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We address issues related to (i) a proposal for resolving a long-standing tension between large volume cosmology and phenomenology as regards reconciliation of requirements of different gravitino masses within the same string-theoretic framework, as well as (ii) evaluation of soft supersymmetry breaking terms and open-string moduli masses in the context of type 1113 large volume compactifications involving orientifolds of the Swiss-cheese Calabi-Yau WCp4[1, 1, 1, 6, 9] with a single mobile space-time filling D3-brane and stacks of D7-branes wrapping the "big" divisor Sigma(B) as well as supporting D7-brane fluxes. In addition, we also include perturbative alpha'-corrections and non-perturbative world-sheet instanton corrections to the Kahler potential as well as Euclidean D3-instanton superpotential. First, using the toric data for the aforementioned Swiss-cheese Calabi-Yau and GLSM techniques, we obtain in the large volume limit, the geometric Kahler potential for the big (and small) divisor(s) in terms of derivatives of genus-two Siegel theta functions. Next, we show that as the mobile space-time filling D3-brane moves from a particular non-singular elliptic curve embedded in the Swiss-cheese Calabi-Yau to another non-singular elliptic curve, it is possible to obtain 10(12) GeV gravitino during the primordial inflationary era as well as, e.g., a TeV gravitino in the present era, within the same set up for the same volume of the Calabi-Yau stabilized at around 10(6)I(s)(6). Then by constructing local (i.e. localized around the location of the mobile D3-brane in the Calabi-Yau) appropriate involutively-odd harmonic one-form on the big divisor that lies in coker(H-(partial derivative) over bar,-((0,1))(CY3) ->(i)* H-(partial derivative) over bar,-((0,1))(Sigma(B))) and extremizing the potential, we show that it is possible to obtain an O(1) gYM from the wrapping of D7-branes on the big divisor due to competing contributions from the Wilson line moduli relative to the divisor volume modulus. To permit gaugino condensation, we take the rigid limit of the big divisor by considering zero sections of the normal bundle of the same - the same being justified by the extremization of the potential. For the purposes of calculation of the gaugino masses, matter moduli masses and soft supersymmetry breaking parameters, we restrict the mobile D3-brane to the big divisor - this has the additional advantage of nullification of the superpotential generated from gaugino condensation. With the inclusion of the matter moduli corresponding to the position moduli of the mobile D3-brane and the Wilson line moduli corresponding to the D7-branes, we obtain gaugino masses of the order of gravitino mass and the matter fields' masses to be enhanced relative to the gravitino mass. The anomaly-mediated gaugino masses are found to be suppressed relative to the gravity-mediated gaugino masses by the standard loop factor. New non-zero contributions to the mu-terms, though sub-dominant in the large volume limit, are obtained from section of the (small) divisor bundle encoding information about the ED3-instanton fluctuation determinant, filling D3-brane and the Wilson line moduli.
   There is a (near) universality in the masses, (mu) over cap -parameters, Yukawa couplings and the (mu) over capB-terms for the D3-brane position moduli - the Higgs doublet in our construction - and a hierarchy in the same set and a universality in the A-terms on inclusionof the D7-brane Wilson line moduli.

AB We consider two optimally mixed neutralino dark matter models, based on nonuniversal gaugino masses, which were recently proposed by us to achieve WMAP compatible relic density over a large part of the minimal supersymmetric standard model parameter space. We compare the resulting predictions for the spin-independent dark matter scattering cross section with the recent CDMS II data, assuming the possibility of the two reported candidate events being signal events. For one model the predicted cross section agrees with the putative signal over a small part of the parameter space, while for the other the agreement holds over the entire WMAP compatible parameter space of the model.

AB We report an indication (3.22 sigma) of approximate to 1860 Hz quasi-periodic oscillations from a neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-536. If confirmed, this will be by far the highest frequency feature observed from an accreting neutron star system, and hence could be very useful in understanding such systems. This plausible timing feature was observed simultaneously with lower (approximate to 585 Hz) and upper (approximate to 904 Hz) kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations. The two kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies had a ratio of approximate to 1.5, and the frequency of the alleged approximate to 1860 Hz feature was close to the triple and the double values of these frequencies. This can be useful for constraining the models of all the three features. In particular, the approximate to 1860 Hz feature could be (1) from a new and heretofore unknown class of quasi-periodic oscillations, or (2) the first observed overtone of lower or upper kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations. Finally, we note that, although the relatively low significance of the approximate to 1860 Hz feature argues for caution, even a 3.22 sigma feature at such a uniquely high frequency should be interesting enough to spur a systematic search in the archival data, as well as to scientifically motivate sufficiently large timing instruments for the next generation X-ray missions.

AB The main objective of this paper is to build and compare vector magnetic maps obtained by two spectral polarimeters, i.e. THEMIS/MTR and Hinode SOT/SP, using two inversion codes (UNNOFIT and MELANIE) based on the Milne -aEuro parts per thousand Eddington solar atmosphere model. To this end, we used observations of a facular region within active region NOAA 10996 on 23 May 2008, and found consistent results concerning the field strength, azimuth and inclination distributions. Because SOT/SP is free from the seeing effect and has better spatial resolution, we were able to resolve small magnetic polarities with sizes of 1aEuro(3) to 2aEuro(3), and we could detect strong horizontal magnetic fields, which converge or diverge in negative or positive facular polarities. These findings support models which suggest the existence of small vertical flux tube bundles in faculae. A new method is proposed to get the relative formation heights of the multi-lines observed by MTR assuming the validity of a flux tube model for the faculae. We found that the Fe i 6302.5 line forms at a greater atmospheric height than the Fe i 5250.2 line.

AB Intensity distributions of the EUV network and the cell interior in the solar atmosphere have been obtained in fourteen emission lines from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) observations. The formation temperature of the observed lines is in the range log T=4.90 -aEuro parts per thousand 6.06 (T in Kelvin), and hence they represent increasing heights in the solar atmosphere from the upper chromosphere and the transition region to the low corona. Intensity distributions of the cell interior have been found to be different in the quiet Sun and the coronal hole even at the lower transition region, which is at variance with some earlier results. The intensity contrast of the network with respect to the cell interior has been obtained for each line, and differences in the quiet Sun and the coronal hole have been examined. The network contrast, in general, is lower for the coronal hole as compared to the quiet Sun, but becomes equal to it in the upper transition region. The maximum contrast for both the regions is at about log T=5.3. Also obtained are the relative contributions of the network and the cell interior to the total intensity. The implications of the results for models of the transition region are briefly mentioned.

AB At first sight, for a static fluid sphere, Effective Mass Energy Density (EMD) appears to be (rho + 3p/c(2)), where rho is the bare mass density, p is the isotropic pressure and c is the speed of light. But it is pointed out that such a direct increase in EMD is valid only for a purely local point of view. And since there is no truly local definition of "gravitational field", such a notion could actually be misleading. On the other hand, by using the Tolman mass formula, we point out that. from a global perspective. the Active Mass Energy Density is root g(00)(rho + 3p/c(2)) and which is obviously smaller than (rho + 3p/c(2)) because g(00) < 1. Then we show that the AGMD eventually is (rho - 3p/c(2)), i.e., exactly opposite to what is generally believed. We further identify the AGMD to be proportional to the Ricci Scalar. By using this fundamental and interesting property, we obtain the GR virial theorem in terms of appropriate "proper energies". (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We consider implications of a possible presence of a Thomson-thick, low-temperature, plasma cloud surrounding the compact object in the binary system Cyg X-3. The presence of such a cloud was earlier inferred from the energy-independent orbital modulation of the X-ray flux and the lack of high frequencies in its power spectra. Here, we study the effect of Compton scattering by the cloud on the X-ray energy and power spectra, concentrating on the hard spectral state. The process reduces the energy of the high-energy break/cut-off in the energy spectra, which allows us to determine the Thomson optical depth. This, together with the observed cut-off in the power spectrum, determines the size of the plasma to be similar to 2 x 10(9) cm. At this size, the cloud will be in thermal equilibrium in the photon field of the X-ray source, which yields the cloud temperature of similar or equal to 3 keV, which refines the determination of the Thomson optical depth to similar to 7. At these parameters, thermal bremsstrahlung emission of the cloud becomes important as well. The physical origin of the cloud is likely to be collision of the very strong stellar wind of the companion Wolf-Rayet star with a small accretion disc formed by the wind accretion. Our model thus explains the peculiar X-ray energy and power spectra of Cyg X-3.

AB We investigate viscous two-temperature accretion disc flows around rotating black holes. We describe the global solution of accretion flows with a sub-Keplerian angular momentum profile, by solving the underlying conservation equations including explicit cooling processes self-consistently. Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and inverse Comptonization of soft photons are considered as possible cooling mechanisms. We focus on the set of solutions for sub-Eddington, Eddington and super-Eddington mass accretion rates around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes with a Kerr parameter of 0.998. It is found that the flow, during its infall from the Keplerian to sub-Keplerian transition region to the black hole event horizon, passes through various phases of advection: the general advective paradigm to the radiatively inefficient phase, and vice versa. Hence, the flow governs a much lower electron temperature similar to 10(8)-10(9.5) K, in the range of accretion rate in Eddington units 0.01 less than or similar to (M) over dot less than or similar to 100, compared to the hot protons of temperature similar to 10(10.2)-10(11.8) K. Therefore, the solution may potentially explain the hard X-rays and gamma-rays emitted from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and X-ray binaries. We then compare the solutions for two different regimes of viscosity. We conclude that a weakly viscous flow is expected to be cooling dominated, particularly at the inner region of the disc, compared to its highly viscous counterpart, which is radiatively inefficient. With all the solutions in hand, we finally reproduce the observed luminosities of the underfed AGNs and quasars (e. g. Sgr A*) to ultraluminous X-ray sources (e. g. SS433), at different combinations of input parameters, such as the mass accretion rate and the ratio of specific heats. The set of solutions also predicts appropriately the luminosity observed in highly luminous AGNs and ultraluminous quasars (e. g. PKS 0743-67).

Their H beta and Mg II emission lines were carefully fit to determine linewidths (full width at half-maximum) as well as equivalent widths (EW) due to the broad emission-line components. The linewidths were used to estimate black hole masses and Eddington ratios, l. Both EWand FWHM are anticorrelated with l. The EW distributions provide no evidence for the hypothesis that a weak jet component in the RQQSOs is responsible for their microvariability.

AB CH stars form a distinct class of objects with characteristic properties like iron deficiency, enrichment of carbon and overabundance of heavy elements. These properties can provide strong observational constraints for the theoretical computation of nucleosynthesis at low metallicity. An important issue is the relative surface density of CH stars, which can provide valuable input to our understanding of the role of low-to intermediate-mass stars in early Galactic chemical evolution. Spectroscopic characterization provides an effective way of identifying CH stars. The present analysis aims at a quantitative assessment of the fraction of CH stars in a sample using a set of spectral classification criteria. The sample consists of 92 objects selected from a collection of candidate faint high-latitude carbon stars from the Hamburg/ESO survey. Medium-resolution (lambda/delta lambda similar to 1300) spectra for these objects were obtained using the Optomechanics Research (OMR) spectrograph at the Vainu Bappu Observatory (VBO), Kavalur and the Himalaya Faint Object Spectrograph (HFOSC) at the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle, during 2007-2009, spanning a wavelength range 3800-6800 angstrom. Spectral analysis shows 36 of the 92 objects to be potential CH stars; combined with our earlier studies this implies similar to 37 per cent (of 243 objects) as the CH fraction. We present spectral descriptions of the newly identified CH star candidates. Estimated effective temperatures, (12)C/(13)C isotopic ratios and their locations on the two-colour J - H versus H - K plot are used to support their identification.

AB We analyze H alpha images, soft X-ray profiles, magnetograms, extreme ultra-violet images and, radio observations of two homologous flare events (M1.4/1N and M9.6/2B) on 2003 November 20 in the active region NOAA 10501 and study properties of reconnection between twisted filament systems, energy release, and associated launch of coronal mass ejections. During both events twisted filaments observed in H alpha approached each other and initiated the flare processes. However, the second event showed the formation of cusp as the filaments interacted. The rotation of sunspots of opposite polarities, inferred from the magnetograms likely powered the twisted filaments and injection of helicity. Along the current sheet between these two opposite polarity sunspots, the shear was maximum, which could have caused the twist in the filament. At the time of interaction between filaments, the reconnection took place and flare emission in thermal and nonthermal energy ranges attained the maximum. The radio signatures revealed the opening of field lines resulting from the reconnection. The H alpha images and radio data provide the inflow speed leading to reconnection and the scale size of the particle acceleration region. The first event produced a narrow and slow CME, whereas the later one was associated with a fast full halo CME. The halo CME signatures observed between the Sun and Earth using white-light and scintillation images and in situ measurements indicated the magnetic energy utilized in the expansion and propagation. The magnetic cloud signature at the Earth confirmed the flux rope ejected at the time of filament interaction and reconnection.

AB We studied how the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) affects the propagation of super-Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min (GZK) protons that originate from extragalactic sources within the local GZK sphere. To this end, we set up hypothetical sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), virtual observers, and the magnetized cosmic web in a model universe constructed from cosmological structure formation simulations. We then arranged a set of reference objects mimicking active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the local universe, with which correlations of simulated UHECR events are analyzed. With our model IGMF, the deflection angle between the arrival direction of super-GZK protons and the sky position of their actual sources is quite large with a mean value of <theta > similar to 15 degrees and a median value of (0) over tilde similar to 7 degrees-10 degrees. On the other hand, the separation angle between the arrival direction and the sky position of nearest reference objects is substantially smaller with < S > similar to 3 degrees.5-4 degrees, which is similar to the mean angular distance in the sky to nearest neighbors among the reference objects. This is a direct consequence of our model that the sources, observers, reference objects, and the IGMF all trace the matter distribution of the universe. The result implies that extragalactic objects lying closest to the arrival direction of UHECRs are not necessarily their actual sources. With our model for the distribution of reference objects, the fraction of super-GZK proton events, whose closest AGNs are true sources, is less than 1/3. We discussed implications of our findings for correlation studies of real UHECR events.

AB Spectra in outburst sources are found to become soft in viscous timescales before going back to hard as in the pre-outburst phase. By using two component accretion disks we show that major characteristics of the spectral evolution can be reproduced. We find that the outburst is possibly caused by a sudden rise in viscosity which gradually converts the sub-Keplerian flow into a Keplerian flow. The decline of the viscosity reduces the Keplerian accretion rate, and the system goes back to hard states. We discuss the genesis of the characteristic shape of the hardness-intensity diagram and reproduce this for the well-known outburst source GRO J1655-40.

AB We present vibrational spectra of methylamine and its ions using the MP2 method and absorption spectra using time dependent density functional method. On the basis of these calculations electronic transitions of methylamine were successfully determined. We also have derived electron affinity and ionization potential for methylamine. The ionization potential 8.98 eV from this work is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 9.04 eV. We found that like neutral methylamine, its cation also displays strong sigma -> sigma* electronic transitions in the vacuum UV region whereas its anion shows strong electronic transitions in both the vacuum and far UV regions. The detection of methylamine in astronomical objects may benefit greatly from the accurate new data on its far-UV and near-IR lines. (C) 2009 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rain drop size distribution (DSD) was measured at four places in Southern India {Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, Munnar and Sriharikota (SHAR)} using a Joss-Waldvogel (JW) impact type disdrometer. The data for each minute were corrected for dead time errors and rain rate was computed from the corrected data. The data for a whole month were then sorted according to rain rate (R) into several classes ranging from 0.1 to > 100 mm/h. The average DSD in each class was computed, and the lognormal distribution function was fitted to the average. In all the cases, the function fitted the data very well. The fit parameters were found to have dependence on rain rate. The total number of drops (N(T)), the geometric mean diameter (D(g)) and the standard geometric deviation (sigma) were also computed from the fit parameters. The standard geometric deviation (sigma) was found to be more or less constant with rain rate at all the sites and in all months. The other two parameters (N(T) and D(g)) were found to vary exponentially with rain rate except in Munnar, a high altitude station. At Thiruvananthapuram, in most of the months, N(T) increased exponentially with rain rate up to some value of R, which was different in different months, and then remained more or less constant or decrease slightly. In all cases, the variation of N(T) and D(g) was such that N(T)D(g)(3) increased linearly with rain rate. (C) 2009 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FIELD; EQUATIONS; SPIN
AB Analytical solutions of Maxwell equations in background spacetime of a black hole in a braneworld immersed in an external uniform magnetic field have been found. The influence of both magnetic and brane parameters on the effective potential of the radial motion of a charged test particle around a slowly rotating black hole in a braneworld immersed in a uniform magnetic field has been investigated by using the Hamilton-Jacobi method. An exact analytical solution for dependence of the radius of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) rISCO from the brane parameter for the motion of a test particle around a nonrotating isolated black hole in a braneworld has been derived. It has been shown that the radius rISCO is monotonically growing with the increase of the module of the brane tidal charge. A comparison of the predictions on rISCO of the braneworld model and of the observational results of ISCO from relativistic accretion disks around black holes provided the upper limit for the brane tidal charge less than or similar to 10(9) cm(2).

We also analyze the dependence of the radius of the photon sphere and deflection angle on dilaton coupling and the cosmological constant in this black hole spacetime. Finally the values of minimum impact parameter, the separation between the first and the other images, as well as the ratio between the flux of the first image and the flux coming from all the other images are determined to characterize some possible distinct signatures of such black holes.

AB Domain wall structure which may form in theories with spontaneously broken parity is generically in conflict with standard cosmology. It has been argued that Planck scale suppressed effects can be sufficient for removing such domain walls. We study this possibility for three specific evolution scenarios for the domain walls, with evolution during a radiation dominated era, during a matter dominated era, and that accompanied by weak inflation. We determine the operators permitted by the supergravity formalism and find that the field content introduced to achieve desired spontaneous parity breaking makes possible Planck scale suppressed terms which can potentially remove the domain walls safely. However, the parity breaking scale, equivalently the Majorana mass scale M(R) of the right-handed neutrino, does get constrained in some of the cases, notably for the matter dominated evolution case which would be generic to string theory inspired models, giving rise to moduli fields. One left-right symmetric model with only triplets and bidoublets is found to be more constrained than another admitting a gauge singlet.

AB We present the results of three separate searches for H i 21-cm absorption in a total of 12 damped Lyman alpha absorption systems (DLAs) and sub-DLAs over the redshift range z(abs) = 0.86-3.37. We find no absorption in the five systems for which we obtain reasonable sensitivities and add the results to those of other recent surveys in order to investigate factors which could have an effect on the detection rate. We provide evidence that the mix of spin temperature/covering factor ratios seen at low redshift may also exist at high redshift, with a correlation between the 21-cm line strength and the total neutral hydrogen column density, indicating a roughly constant spin temperature/covering factor ratio for all of the DLAs searched. Also, by considering the geometry of a flat expanding Universe together with the projected sizes of the background radio emission regions, we find, for the detections, that the 21-cm line strength is correlated with the size of the absorber. For the non-detections, it is apparent that larger absorbers (covering factors) are required in order to exhibit 21-cm absorption, particularly if these DLAs do not arise in spiral galaxies. We also suggest that the recent z(abs) = 2.3 detection towards TXS 0311+430 arises in a spiral galaxy, but on the basis of a large absorption cross-section and high metallicity, rather than a low spin temperature.

AB We report the results of CCD V, r and I time-series photometry of the globular cluster NGC 5053. New times of maximum light are given for the eight known RR Lyrae stars in the field of our images, and their periods are revised. Their V light curves were Fourier decomposed to estimate their physical parameters. A discussion on the accuracy of the Fourier-based iron abundances, temperatures, masses and radii is given. New periods are found for the five known SX Phe stars, and a critical discussion of their secular period changes is offered. The mean iron abundance for the RR Lyrae stars is found to be [Fe/H] similar to -1.97 +/- 0.16 and lower values are not supported by the present analysis. The absolute magnitude calibrations of the RR Lyrae stars yield an average true distance modulus of 16.12 +/- 0.04 or a distance of 16.7 +/- 0.3 kpc. Comparison of the observational colour magnitude diagram (CMD) with theoretical isochrones indicates an age of 12.5 +/- 2.0 Gyr for the cluster. A careful identification of all reported blue stragglers (BS) and their V, I magnitudes leads to the conclusion that BS12, BS22, BS23 and BS24 are not BS. On the other hand, three new BS are reported. Variability was found in seven BS, very likely of the SX Phe type in five of them, and in one red giant star. The new SX Phe stars follow established Period-Luminosity relationships and indicate a distance in agreement with the distance from the RR Lyrae stars.

AB We study the complexity of supergranular cells using the intensity patterns obtained at the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory during the solar maximum. Our data consist of visually identified supergranular cells, from which a fractal dimension D for supergranulation is obtained according to the relation P proportional to AD/2, where A is the area and P the perimeter of the supergranular cells. We find a fractal dimension of about 1.12 for active region cells and about 1.25 for quiet region cells, a difference that could be attributed to the inhibiting effect of the magnetic field.

AB We present a careful and detailed light curve analysis of RR Lyrae stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) discovered by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) project. Out of 536 single-mode RR Lyrae stars selected from the data base, we have investigated the physical properties of 335 'normal-looking' RRab stars and 17 RRc stars that have good quality photometric light curves. We have also been able to estimate the distance modulus of the cloud which is in good agreement with those determined from other independent methods. The Fourier decomposition method has been used to study the basic properties of these variables. Accurate Fourier decomposition parameters of 536 RR Lyrae stars in the OGLE-II data base are computed. Empirical relations between the Fourier parameters and some physical parameters of these variables have been used to estimate the physical parameters for the stars from the Fourier analysis. Further, the Fourier decomposition of the light curves of the SMC RR Lyrae stars yields their mean physical parameters as [Fe/H] = -1.56 +/- 0.25, M = 0.55 +/- 0.01M(circle dot), Teff = 6404 +/- 12K, logL = 1.60 +/- 0.01 L(circle dot) and MV = 0.78 +/- 0.02 for 335 RRab variables and [Fe/H] = -1.90 +/- 0.13, M = 0.82 +/- 0.18M(circle dot), T(eff) = 7177 +/- 16K, log L = 1.62 +/- 0.02 L(circle dot) and MV = 0.76 +/- 0.05 for 17 RRc stars. Using the absolute magnitude together with the mean magnitude, intensity-weighted mean magnitude and the phase-weighted mean magnitude of the RR Lyrae stars, the mean distance modulus to the SMC is estimated to be 18.86 +/- 0.01, 18.83 +/- 0.01 and 18.84 +/- 0.01 mag, respectively, from the RRab stars. From the RRc stars, the corresponding distance modulus values are found to be 18.92 +/- 0.04, 18.89 +/- 0.04 and 18.89 +/- 0.04 mag, respectively. Since the Fourier analysis is a very powerful tool for the study of the physical properties of the RR Lyrae stars, we emphasize the importance of exploring the reliability of the calculation of Fourier parameters together with the uncertainty estimates keeping in view the large collections of photometric light curves that will become available from variable star projects of the future.

AB The beamed radio emission from relativistic plasma ( particles or bunches), constrained to move along the curved trajectories, occurs in the direction of velocity. We have generalized the coherent curvature radiation model to include the detailed geometry of the emission region in pulsar magnetosphere and deduced the polarization state in terms of Stokes parameters. By considering both the uniform and modulated emissions, we have simulated a few typical pulse profiles. The antisymmetric type of circular polarization survives only when there is modulation or discrete distribution in the emitting sources. Our model predicts a correlation between the polarization angle swing and sign reversal of circular polarization as a geometric property of the emission process.

AB The simultaneous measurements of zonal drift velocities, observed in the heights of 84-98 km in the Indian geomagnetic dip equatorial region by an medium frequency (MF, 1.98 MHz) spaced antenna and a high-frequency (HF, 18 MHz) Doppler radars, are compared on selected few days in the solar maximum years of 1998, 1999, and 2000. The agreement between the two radar measurements is found to be good below about 88 km, where the neutral turbulence induced ionospheric irregularities are more predominant. Above 90 km, however, the agreement becomes poor and at the highest height of 98 km it becomes the least. At this height, more often the HF Doppler radar shows a westward drift of about 200 m/s whereas the MF spaced antenna radar values lie within +/- 10 m/s and sometimes attain maximum values of +/- 50 m/s. Detailed discussions are made on the possible sources of underestimation of the drift velocities measured by the MF radar and the nature of scattering irregularities that are produced because of large neutral turbulences and plasma instabilities. It is suggested that these neutral and plasma turbulences (particularly type II plasma irregularities) contribute in a different manner to different radar frequencies and techniques and hence very different drift velocities in the heights of 90-100 km particularly in the geomagnetic dip equatorial region. Discussions are also made on (1) the real atmospheric and ionospheric physical process prevailing in the 90-100 km region and (2) the technical aspects of the radars that limits them to measure only particular types of motion in this region.

   MIDDLE; PENETRATION; TRANSPORT
AB A physical mechanism of the positive ionospheric storms at low latitudes and midlatitudes is presented through multi-instrument observations, theoretical modeling, and basic principles. According to the mechanism, an equatorward neutral wind is required to produce positive ionospheric storms. The mechanical effects of the wind (1) reduce (or stop) the downward diffusion of plasma along the geomagnetic field lines, (2) raise the ionosphere to high altitudes of reduced chemical loss, and hence (3) accumulate the plasma at altitudes near and above the ionospheric peak centered at around +/- 30 degrees magnetic latitudes. Daytime eastward prompt penetration electric field (PPEF), if it occurs, also shifts the equatorial ionization anomaly crests to higher than normal latitudes, up to approximately +/- 30 degrees latitudes. The positive ionospheric storms are most likely in the longitudes where the onset of the geomagnetic storms falls in the ionization production dominated morning-noon local time sector when the plasma accumulation due to the mechanical effects of the wind largely exceeds the plasma loss due to the chemical effect of the wind. The mechanism agrees with the multi-instrument observations made during the supergeomagnetic storm of 7-8 November 2004, with 18 h long initial phase (IP) and 10 h long main phase (MP). The observations, which are mainly in the Japanese-Australian longitudes where the MP onset was in the morning (0600 LT, 2100 UT), show (1) strong positive ionospheric storms (in Ne, Nmax, hmax, Global Positioning System-total electron content (GPS-TEC), and 630 nm airglow intensity) in both Northern and Southern hemispheres started at the morning (0600 LT) MP onset and lasted for a day, (2) repeated occurrence of strong eastward PPEF events penetrated after the MP onset and superposed with westward electric field started before the MP onset, and (3) storm time equatorward neutral winds (inferred from 1 and 2). Repeated occurrence of an unusually strong F-3 layer with large density depletions around the equator was also observed during the morning-noon MP.

AB Diurnal and seasonal variations of critical frequency of ionospheric F2-region 'foF2' and the height of peak density 'hmF2' are studied using modern digital ionosonde observations of equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) crest region, Bhopal (23.2 degrees N, 77.6 degrees E, dip 18.5 degrees N), during solar minimum period 2007. Median values of these parameters are obtained at each hour using manually scaled data during different seasons and compared with the International Reference Ionosphere-2001 model predictions. The observations suggest that oil seasonal basis, the highest values of foF2 are observed during equinox months, whereas highest values of hmF2 are obtained in summer and lowest values of both foF2 and hmF2 are observed during winter. The observed median and IRI predicted values of foF2 and hmF2 are analyzed with upper and lower bound of inter-quartile range (IQR) and it is find out that the observed median values are well inside the inter-quartile range during the period of 2007. Comparison of the recorded foF2 and hmF2 values with the IRI-2001 output reveals that IRI predicted values exhibit better agreement with hmF2 as compared to foF2. In general, the IRI model predictions show some agreement with the observations during the year 2007. Therefore it is still necessary to implement improvements ill order to obtain better predictions for EIA regions. (C) 2009 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present deep UBVRI CCD photometry of six open star clusters situated in the Galactic anticenter region (l similar to 120-200 degrees). The sample includes three unstudied (Be 6, Be 77, King 17) and three partly studied open clusters (Be 9, NGC 2186, and NGC 2304). The fundamental parameters have been determined by comparing color-color and color-magnitude diagrams with the theoretical models. The structural parameters and morphology of the clusters were discussed on the basis of radial density profiles and isodensity contours, respectively. The isodensity contours show that all the clusters have asymmetric shapes. An investigation of structural parameters indicates that the evolution of core and corona of the clusters is mainly controlled by internal relaxation processes.

AB Context. Helioseismology has enabled us to better understand the solar interior, while also allowing us to better constrain solar models. But now is a tremendous epoch for asteroseismology as space missions dedicated to studying stellar oscillations have been launched within the last years (MOST and CoRoT). CoRoT has already proved valuable results for many types of stars, while Kepler, which was launched in March 2009, will provide us with a huge number of seismic data very soon. This is an opportunity to better constrain stellar models and to finally understand stellar structure and evolution.
   Aims. The goal of this research work is to estimate the global parameters of any solar-like oscillating target in an automatic manner. We want to determine the global parameters of the acoustic modes (large separation, range of excited pressure modes, maximum amplitude, and its corresponding frequency), retrieve the surface rotation period of the star and use these results to estimate the global parameters of the star (radius and mass).
   Methods. To prepare for the arrival and the analysis of hundreds of solar-like oscillating stars, we have developed a robust and automatic pipeline, which was partially adapted from helioseismic methods. The pipeline consists of data analysis techniques, such as Fast Fourier Transform, wavelets, autocorrelation, as well as the application of minimisation algorithms for stellar-modelling.
   Results. We apply our pipeline to some simulated lightcurves from the asteroFLAG team and the Aarhus-asteroFLAG simulator, and obtain results that are consistent with the input data to the simulations. Our strategy gives correct results for stars with magnitudes below 11 with only a few 10% of bad determinations among the reliable results. We then apply the pipeline to the Sun and three CoRoT targets. In particular we determine the large separation and radius of the Sun, HD49933, HD181906, and HD181420.

TI X-rays from Saturn: a study with XMM-Newton and Chandra over the years

AB Aim. We approach the study of Saturn and its environment in a novel way using X-ray data, by making a systematic and uniform spectral analysis of all the X-ray observations of the planet to date.
   Methods. We present the results of the two most recent (2005) XMM-Newton observations of Saturn together with the re-analysis of an earlier (2002) observation from the XMM-Newton archive and of three Chandra observations in 2003 and 2004. While the XMM-Newton telescope resolution does not enable us to resolve spatially the contributions of the planet's disk and rings to the X-ray flux, we can estimate their strengths and their evolution over the years from spectral analysis, and compare them with those observed with Chandra.
   Results. The spectrum of the X-ray emission is well fitted by an optically thin coronal model with an average temperature of 0.5 keV. The addition of a fluorescent oxygen emission line at similar to 0.53 keV improves the fits significantly. In accordance with earlier reports, we interpret the coronal component as emission from the planetary disk, produced by the scattering of solar X-rays in Saturn's upper atmosphere, and the line as originating from the Saturnian rings. The strength of the disk X-ray emission is seen to decrease over the period 2002-2005, following the decay of solar activity towards the current minimum in the solar cycle. By comparing the relative fluxes of the disk X-ray emission and the oxygen line, we suggest that the line strength does not vary over the years in the same fashion as the disk flux. We consider possible alternatives for the origin of the line. The connection between solar activity and the strength of Saturn's disk X-ray emission is investigated and compared with that of Jupiter. We also discuss the apparent lack of X-ray aurorae on Saturn; by comparing the planet's parameters relevant to aurora production with those of Jupiter we conclude that Saturnian X-ray aurorae are likely to have gone undetected because they are below the sensitivity threshold of current Earth-bound observatories. A similar comparison for Uranus and Neptune leads to the same disappointing conclusion, which is likely to hold true also with the planned next generation International X-ray Observatory. The next step in advancing this research can only be realised with in-situ X-ray observations at the planets.

AB Context. The solar rotation profile is conical rather than cylindrical as it could be expected from classical rotating fluid dynamics (e.g. Taylor-Proudman theorem). Thermal coupling to the tachocline, baroclinic effects and latitudinal transport of heat have been suggested to explain this peculiar state of rotation.
   Aims. To test the validity of thermal wind balance in the solar convection zone using helioseismic inversions for both the angular velocity and fluctuations in entropy and temperature. Methods. Entropy and temperature fluctuations obtained from 3D hydrodynamical numerical simulations of the solar convection zone are compared with solar profiles obtained from helioseismic inversions.
   Results. The temperature and entropy fluctuations in 3D numerical simulations have smaller amplitude in the bulk of the solar convection zone than those derived from seismic inversions. Seismic inversion provides variations of temperature from about 1 K at the surface to up to 100 K at the base of the convection zone while in 3D simulations they are of an order of 10 K throughout the convection zone up to 0.96 R(circle dot). In 3D simulations, baroclinic effects are found to be important to tilt the isocontours of Omega away from a cylindrical profile in most of the convection zone, helped by Reynolds and viscous stresses at some locations. By contrast the baroclinic effect inverted by helioseismology is much larger than what is required to yield the observed angular velocity profile.
   Conclusions. The solar convection does not appear to be in strict thermal wind balance, Reynolds stresses must play a dominant role in setting not only the equatorial acceleration but also the observed conical angular velocity profile.

AB Context. Determining ages of the outer and the inner lobes of so-called double-double radio galaxies (DDRGs) is crucial for understanding the active cycles of galactic nuclei, the phases of interruption of the jet flow, and physical conditions in the surrounding galactic and intergalactic medium governing the jets' propagation. A recognition and understanding of these conditions during the restarted jet activity is of special interest.
   Aims. We determine the ages and other physical characteristics of the outer and the inner lobes of the DDRG J1548-3216, as well as the properties of the surrounding environment during the original and the restarted phase of the jets' activity.
   Methods. Using the new low-frequency and high-frequency radio images of this galaxy, we determined the shape of the spectrum along its lobes and performed the classical spectral-ageing analysis. On the other hand, we applied the analytical model of the jet's dynamics, which allowed us to derive the physical conditions for the source's evolution during the original jet propagation through the unperturbed IGM, as well as those when the restarted new jet propagates inside the outer cocoon formed by the old jet material that passed through the jet terminal shock.
   Results. The dynamical age estimate of the outer and the inner lobes is 132 +/- 28 Myr and similar to 9 +/- 4 Myr, respectively. The synchrotron age in the outer lobes systematically rises from similar to 25 Myr in the vicinity of the lobes' edges to about 65-75 Myr in the centre of the old cocoon. These ages imply an average expansion speed along the jets' axis: (0.012 +/- 0.003)c in the outer lobes and (0.058 +/- 0.025)c in the inner lobes, but the latter speed would be similar to 0.25 c when they were of age less than 1 Myr. We find that the jet power during the restarted activity is about ten-fold fainter than that of the original jet. Similar disproportion is found for the internal pressures and the magnetic field strengths in the old cocoon and those in the inner lobes. This disproportion can be effectively reduced by assuming the same equations of state for the emitting particles and the magnetic fields within the old and the new lobes. However, we think that our assumption of the non-relativistic equation of state for the old cocoon and the relativistic one for the new lobes is more justified.

AB A lead-free neutron monitor predominantly sensitive to a few MeV energy secondary neutrons produced by the cosmic ray interactions with the earth's atmosphere is described in this paper. The monitor was originally aimed at recording neutron bursts supposedly produced in the atmospheric lightning discharges. Besides operating in the integral counting mode to record neutron background in the atmosphere the monitor is also configured to record rates of neutron bunches, in pre-determined small time intervals of 50 ms duration, that are produced in the atmosphere due to cosmic ray interaction. The monitor is seen to compare very well with the existing conventional neutron monitors in responding to transient solar modulation. However, the data on neutron bunches indicate large scale reduction in their occurrences at the time of solar events. Such variations have never been recorded by the conventional neutron monitors.

AB The compact binary system in OJ287 is modeled to contain a spinning primary black hole with an accretion disk and a non-spinning secondary black hole. Using post-Newtonian (PN) accurate equations that include 2.5PN accurate non-spinning contributions, the leading-order general relativistic and classical spin-orbit terms, the orbit of the binary black hole in OJ287 is calculated and as expected it depends on the spin of the primary black hole. Using the orbital solution, the specific times when the orbit of the secondary crosses the accretion disk of the primary are evaluated such that the record of observed outbursts from 1913 up to 2007 is reproduced. The timings of the outbursts are quite sensitive to the spin value. In order to reproduce all the known outbursts, including a newly discovered one in 1957, the Kerr parameter of the primary has to be 0.28 +/- 0.08. The quadrupole-moment contributions to the equations of motion allow us to constrain the "no-hair" parameter to be 1.0 +/- 0.3, where 0.3 is the 1 sigma error. This supports the "black hole no-hair theorem" within the achievable precision. It should be possible to test the present estimate in 2015 when the next outburst is due. The timing of the 2015 outburst is a strong function of the spin: if the spin is 0.36 of the maximal value allowed in general relativity, the outburst begins in early 2015 November, while the same event starts in the end of January 2016 if the spin is 0.2.

AB The relative importance of different initiation mechanisms for coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the Sun is uncertain. One possible mechanism is the loss of equilibrium of coronal magnetic flux ropes formed gradually by large-scale surface motions. In this paper, the locations of flux rope ejections in a recently developed quasi-static global evolution model are compared with observed CME source locations over a 4.5 month period in 1999. Using extreme ultraviolet data, the low-coronal source locations are determined unambiguously for 98 out of 330 CMEs. An alternative method of determining the source locations using recorded Ha events was found to be too inaccurate. Despite the incomplete observations, positive correlation (with coefficient up to 0.49) is found between the distributions of observed and simulated ejections, but only when binned into periods of 1 month or longer. This binning timescale corresponds to the time interval at which magnetogram data are assimilated into the coronal simulations, and the correlation arises primarily from the large-scale surface magnetic field distribution; only a weak dependence is found on the magnetic helicity imparted to the emerging active regions. The simulations are limited in two main ways: they produce fewer ejections, and they do not reproduce the strong clustering of observed CME sources into active regions. Due to this clustering, the horizontal gradient of radial photospheric magnetic field is better correlated with the observed CME source distribution (coefficient 0.67). Our results suggest that while the gradual formation of magnetic flux ropes over weeks can account for many observed CMEs, especially at higher latitudes, there exists a second class of CMEs (at least half) for which dynamic active region flux emergence on shorter timescales must be the dominant factor. Improving our understanding of CME initiation in future will require both more comprehensive observations of CME source regions and more detailed magnetic field simulations.

AB We present relativistic close-coupling photoionization calculations of Ni XV using the Breit-Pauli R-matrix method to obtain photoionization cross section of Ni XV from the ground state 3s(2)3p(2)((3)P(0)) and the lowest four 3s23p2 ((3)P(1,2), (1)D(2), (1)S(0)) excited states. A multiconfiguration eigenfunction expansion of the core Ni XVI is employed with configurations 3s(2)3p, 3s(3)p(2), 3s(2)3d, 3p(3), 3s3p3d, 3p(2)3d, 3s3d(2), 3p3d(2). We have included the lowest 40 target level states of Ni XVI in the photoionization calculations of Ni XV. Cross sections are determined by the Rydberg series of autoionizing resonances converging to several ionic states of Ni XVI. In our calculations, we have taken into account all the important physical effects such as exchange, channel coupling, and short-range correlation. Further, relativistic effects are incorporated by including mass correction, Darwin term, and spin-orbit interaction terms. The present calculations using the lowest 40 target levels of Ni XVI are presented for the first time and can be useful for modeling the ionization balance of Ni XV in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.

AB The effect of a non-uniform magnetic field on the gravitational instability for a non-uniformly rotating, infinitely extending axisymmetric cylinder in a homogeneous medium has been studied. The Bel and Schatzman criterion of gravitational instability for a non-uniformly rotating medium is modified under the effect of a non-uniform/uniform magnetic field acting along the tangential and axial directions. As a consequence the stabilizing and destabilizing effect of the non-uniform magnetic field is obtained, a new criterion for the magneto-gravitational instability is deduced in terms of Alfven's wave velocity; and it is also found that the Jeans criterion determines the gravitational instability in the absence of rotation and when the non-uniform/uniform magnetic field acts along the axis of the cylinder.

AB In this work, we consider radiation (thermal) instability in a weakly ionized plasma with continuous ionization and recombination. The situation can be visualized in the case of envelopes of planetary nebulae, which are envelopes of ionized plasmas surrounding red giant stars. Various observations report continuous photoionization of these plasmas by the highly energetic streams of photons emanating from the parent star. Recently, it has been shown that thermal instability can be a probable candidate in such plasmas for the existence of small scale structures (viz., striations) whose kinematic age is much smaller than that of the parent nebula. We therefore report a systematic study of these plasmas with photoionization and determine the instability domain. We have shown that the continuous ionization and recombination may lead to modification of the underlying instability, which may limit the size of the small structures that are believed to form from these instabilities, and may thus provide an explanation of the physical processes responsible for the existence of these structures. We further show that in many cases the system bifurcates to an ovserstable (growing wave) state from a condensation instability (monotonic) and vice versa.

AB Investigations are made on slowly rotating radiating Universes coupled with a scalar field in the spherically symmetric Einstein formalism, and some new interesting solutions are obtained. Their physical and geometrical properties are studied from various angles. The rotational perturbations of such models are examined in order to substantiate the possibility that the universe is endowed with some rotation. The nature and role of the metric rotation as well as that of the rotation of matter are studied, and the effects of radiation and scalar fields on them are discussed. The models here turn out to be rotating as well as expanding ones, which may be taken as good examples of real astrophysical objects in this universe. The periods of the physical validity and the restrictions on the radii of the models for real astrophysical situations are obtained and discussed. The models obtained here are theoretically satisfactory and therefore there is a possibility that there may be less known objects in this universe which may be represented by our model Universes obtained here and many unknown properties of this universe may be explored and unfolded in the study of these models.

AB Binaries are in vogue; many minor-planets like asteroids are being found to be binary or contact-binary systems. Even ternaries like 87 Sylvia have been discovered. The densities of these binaries are often estimated to be very low, and this, along with suspected accretionary origins, hints at a rubble interior. As in the case of fluid objects, a rubble-pile is unable to sustain all manners of spin, self-gravitation, and tidal interactions. This motivates the present study of the possible ellipsoidal shapes and mutual separations that members of a rubble-pile binary system may achieve. Conversely, knowledge of a granular binary's shape and separation will constrain its internal structure - the ability of the binary's members to sustain elongated shapes and/or maintain contact will hint at appreciable internal frictional strength. Because the binary's members are allowed to be of comparable mass, the present investigation constitutes an extension of the second classical Darwin problem to granular aggregates.
   General equations defining the ellipsoidal rubble-pile binary system's equilibrium are developed. These are then specialized to a pair of spin-locked, possibly unequal, prolate ellipsoidal granular aggregates aligned along their long axes. We observe that contact rubble-pile binaries can indeed exist. Further, depending on the binary's geometry, an equilibrium contact binary's members may, in fact, disrupt if separated. These results are applied to four suspected or known binaries: 216 Kleopatra, 25143 Itokawa, 624 Hektor and 90 Antiope. This exercise helps to bound the shapes and/or provide information about the interiors of these binaries.
   The binary's interior will be modeled as a rigid-plastic, cohesionless material with a Drucker-Prager yield criterion. This theology is a reasonable first model for rubble piles. We employ an approximate volume-averaging procedure that is based on the classical method of moments, and is an extension of the virial method (Chandrasekhar, S., 1969. Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT) to granular solid bodies. The present approach also helps us present an incrementally consistent approach to investigate the equilibrium shapes of fluid binaries, while highlighting the inconsistencies and errors inherent in the popular "Roche binary approximation".

AB Weak gravitational lensing of the CMBR manifests as a secondary anisotropy in the temperature maps. The effect, quantified through the shear and convergence fields imprint the underlying large scale structure (LSS), geometry and evolution history of the Universe. It is hence perceived to be an important observational probe of cosmology. De-lensing the CMBR temperature maps is also crucial for detecting the gravitational wave generated B-modes. Future observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from the cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution hold the potential of probing the LSS over a large redshift range. We have investigated the correlation between post-reionization HI signal and weak lensing convergence field. Assuming that the HI follows the dark matter distribution, the cross-correlation angular power spectrum at a multipole l is found to be proportional to the cold dark matter power spectrum evaluated at l/r, where r denotes the comoving distance to the redshift where the HI is located. The amplitude of the cross-correlation depends on quantities specific to the HI distribution, growth of perturbations and also the underlying cosmological model. In an ideal situation, we found that a statistically significant detection of the cross-correlation signal is possible. If detected, the cross-correlation signal holds the possibility of a joint estimation of cosmological parameters and also may be used to test various CMBR de-lensing estimators.

AB We report the results of our intensive intranight optical monitoring of eight optically bright 'radio-intermediate quasars' (RIQs) having flat or inverted radio spectra. The monitoring was carried out in R band on 25 nights during 2005-2009. On each night only one RIQ was monitored for a minimum duration of similar to 4 h (the average being 5.2 h per night). Using the CCD as an N-star photometer, an intranight optical variability (INOV) detection threshold of similar to 1-2 per cent was achieved for the densely sampled differential light curves derived from our data. These observations amount to a large increase over those reported hitherto for this rare and sparsely studied class of quasars which can, however, play an important role in understanding the link between the dominant varieties of powerful active galactic nucleus, namely the radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), radio-loud quasars (RLQs) and blazars. Despite the probable presence of relativistically boosted nuclear jets, inferred from their flat/inverted radio spectra, clear evidence for INOV in our extensive observations was detected only on one night. Furthermore, flux variation between two consecutive nights was clearly seen for one of the RIQs. These results demonstrate that as a class, RIQs are much less extreme in nuclear activity compared to blazars. The availability in the literature of INOV data for another two RIQs conforming to our selection criteria allowed us to enlarge the sample to 10 RIQs (monitored on a total of 42 nights for a minimum duration of similar to 4 h per night). The absence of large amplitude INOV (psi >= 3 per cent) persists in this enlarged sample. This extensive data base have enabled us to arrive at the first estimate for the INOV duty cycle (DC) of RIQs. The DC is found to be small (similar to 9 per cent), increasing to similar to 14 per cent if the two cases of 'probable' INOV are included. The corresponding value is known to be similar to 60 per cent for BL Lacs and approximate to 15 per cent for both RLQs and RQQs, if they too are monitored for greater than or similar to 4-6 h in each session. Our observations also provide information about the long-term optical variability of RIQs, which is found to be fairly common and reaches typical amplitudes of approximate to 0.1 mag. The light curves of these RIQs are briefly discussed in the context of a theoretical framework proposed earlier for linking this rare kind of quasars to the much better studied dominant classes of quasars.

AB We have used a statistical technique 'Shuffle' in seven nearly two-dimensional strips from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 (SDSS DR6) to test if the statistically significant length-scale of filaments depends on luminosity, colour and morphology of galaxies. We find that although the average filamentarity depends on these galaxy properties, the statistically significant length-scale of filaments does not depend on them. We compare its measured values in SDSS against the predictions of Lambda cold dark matter (Lambda CDM) N-body simulations and find that Lambda CDM model is consistent with observations. The average filamentarity is known to be very sensitive to the bias parameter. Using Lambda CDM N-body simulations, we simulate mock galaxy distributions for SDSS Northern Galactic Cap equatorial strip for different biases and test if the statistically significant length-scale of filaments depends on bias. We find that statistically significant length-scale of filaments is nearly independent of bias. This result is possibly related to the fact that statistically significant length-scale of filaments is nearly the same for different classes of galaxies which are differently biased with respect to underlying dark matter distribution. The average filamentarity is also known to be dependent on the galaxy number density and size of the samples. We use Lambda CDM dark matter N-body simulations to test if the statistically significant length-scale of filaments depends on number density of galaxies and size of the samples. Our analysis shows that the statistically significant length-scale of filaments very weakly depends on these factors. Finally, we test the reliability of our method by applying it to controlled samples of segment Cox process and find that our method successfully recovers the length of the inputted segments. Summarizing these results, we conclude that the length-scale up to which the filaments are statistically significant is a robust measure of galaxy distribution.

AB The study of the scattering and extinction properties of possible nanodiamond grains in the interstellar medium (ISM) are reported. Calculations using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) for varying ellipsoidal shapes and sizes from 2.5 to 10 nm are considered. Nanodiamonds show negligible extinction from the infrared to the near-ultraviolet, and a very sharp far-ultraviolet rise. Comparison with observations rules out the possibility of independent nanodiamond dust but points towards the possibility of nanodiamonds as a component in the ISM. Radiation-induced transformations may lead to carbonaceous grains with different cores and mantles. Calculations are therefore also performed for a core-mantle target model with nanodiamond cores in graphite mantles. The graphite extinction features become modified, with the peak at 2175 angstrom being lowered, broadened, blueshifted and accompanied by enhanced extinction in the far-ultraviolet. Such variations in the 2175-angstrom band and a simultaneous far-ultraviolet rise are observed along some sources. A three-component dust model incorporating silicate, graphite and graphite with a nanodiamond core is also considered. The model extinction compares very well with the average Galactic extinction in the complete range from 0.2 to 10 mu m(-1). The best fit requires a small size and a small number of nanodiamonds.

AB Some of the cleanest signals for new physics in the early runs of the LHC will involve strongly produced particles which give rise to multiple leptons by undergoing cascade decays through weakly interacting states to stable particles. Some of the most spectacular final states will involve three or more leptons, multiple jets and generally missing energy-momentum as well. A triad of the most interesting models of new physics which induce such signals is known to consist of (i) supersymmetry with R-parity conservation, (ii) a universal extra dimension with conservation of KK-parity, and (iii) little Higgs models with conserved T-parity. Similar signals could also arise if the standard model is augmented with a fourth sequential generation of heavy fermions. We study all these possibilities and show that a judiciously chosen set of observables, critically involving the number of identifiable jets and leptons, can collectively provide distinct footprints for each of these models. In fact, simple pairwise correlation of such observables can enable unambiguous identification of the underlying model, even with a relatively small data sample.

AB We consider the possibility of the Higgs mechanism in the bulk in a generalized Randall-Sundrum model, where a nonvanishing cosmological constant is induced on the visible brane. This scenario has the advantage of accommodating positive tension of the visible brane and thus ensures stability of the model. It is shown that several problems usually associated with this mechanism are avoided if some dimensionful parameters in the bulk are allowed to lie a little below the Planck mass. The most important of these is keeping the lowest massive mode in the scale of the standard electroweak model, and at the same time reducing the gauge coupling of the next excited state, thus ameliorating otherwise stringent phenomenological constraints.

AB Dark matter, baryonic matter, and dark energy have different properties but contribute comparable energy density to the present Universe. We point out that they may have a common origin. As the dark energy has a scale far lower than all known scales in particle physics but very close to neutrino masses, while the excess matter over antimatter in the baryonic sector is probably related to the neutrino-mass generation, we unify the origin of the dark and visible universe in a variant of the seesaw model. In our model (i) the dark matter relic density is a dark matter asymmetry emerged simultaneously with the baryon asymmetry from leptogenesis; (ii) the dark energy is due to a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson associated with the neutrino-mass generation.

AB We consider a locally scale invariant extension of the Standard Model of particle physics and argue that it fits both the particle and cosmological observations. The model is scale invariant both classically and quantum mechanically. The scale invariance is broken (or hidden) by a mechanism which we refer to as cosmological symmetry breaking. This produces all the dimensionful parameters in the theory. The cosmological constant or dark energy is a prediction of the theory and can be calculated systematically order by order in perturbation theory. It is expected to be finite at all orders. The model does not suffer from the hierarchy problem due to the absence of scalar particles, including the Higgs, from the physical spectrum.

ID IC SUPERNOVAE; BLAST WAVES; GRB 980425; EMISSION; 1998BW; RATES; ARRAY
AB Long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) mark(1) the explosive death of some massive stars and are a rare sub-class of type Ibc supernovae. They are distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativistic outflow powered(2) by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star). Observationally, this outflow is manifested(3) in the pulse of gamma-rays and a long-lived radio afterglow. Until now, central-engine driven supernovae have been discovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expected(4) that a larger population goes undetected because of limited satellite sensitivity or beaming of the collimated emission away from our line of sight. In this framework, the recovery of undetected GRBs may be possible through radio searches(5,6) for type Ibc supernovae with relativistic outflows. Here we report the discovery of luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary type Ibc SN 2009bb, which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine. A comparison with our radio survey of type Ibc supernovae reveals that the fraction harbouring central engines is low, about one per cent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferred(7) rate of nearby GRBs. Independently, a second mildly relativistic supernova has been reported(8).

AB It has long been argued that better timing precision allowed by satellites like Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) will allow us to measure the orbital eccentricity and the angle of periastron of some of the bright persistent high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and hence a possible measurement of apsidal motion in these system. Measuring the rate of apsidal motion allows one to estimate the apsidal motion constant of the mass losing companion star and hence allows for the direct testing of the stellar structure models for these giant stars present in the HMXBs. In the present paper, we use the archival RXTE data of two bright persistent sources, namely Cen X-3 and SMC X-1, to measure the very small orbital eccentricity and the angle of periastron. We find that the small variations in the pulse profiles of these sources, rather than the intrinsic time resolution provided by RXTE, limit the accuracy with which we can measure arrival time of the pulses from these sources. This influences the accuracy with which one can measure the orbital parameters, especially the very small eccentricity and the angle of periastron in these sources. The observations of SMC X-1 in the year 2000 were taken during the high-flux state of the source and we could determine the orbital eccentricity and omega using this data set.

AB We present seven light curves of the exoplanet systemHAT-P-3, taken as part of a transit timing programme using the rapid imager to search for exoplanets instrument on the Liverpool Telescope. The light curves are analysed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to update the parameters of the system. The inclination is found to be i = 86.75(-0.21)(+0.22)degrees, the planet-star radius ratio to be R(p)/R(*) = 0.1098(-0.0012)(+0.0010) and the stellar radius to be R(*) = 0.834(-0.026)(+0.018) R(circle dot), consistent with previous results but with a significant improvement in the precision. Central transit times and uncertainties for each light curve are also determined, and a residual permutation algorithm is used as an independent check on the errors. The transit times are found to be consistent with a linear ephemeris, and a new ephemeris is calculated as T(c)(0) = 2454856.701 18 +/- 0.000 18 HJD and P = 2.899 738 +/- 0.000 007 d. Model timing residuals are fitted to the measured timing residuals to place upper mass limits for a hypothetical perturbing planet as a function of the period ratio. These show that we have probed for planets with masses as low as 0.33 and 1.81 M(sic) in the interior and exterior 2: 1 resonances, respectively, assuming the planets are initially in circular orbits.

AB We investigate the dynamical structure of advective accretion flow around stationary as well as rotating black holes. For a suitable choice of input parameters, such as accretion rate ((M) over dot) and angular momentum (lambda), a global accretion solution may include a shock wave. The post-shock flow is located at a few tens times the Schwarzchild radius and is generally very hot and dense. This successfully mimics the so-called Compton cloud, which is believed to be responsible for emitting hard radiation. Owing to the radiative loss, significant energy is removed from the accreting matter and the shock moves forward towards the black hole in order to maintain the pressure balance across it. We identify the effective area of parameter space ((M) over dot-lambda) that allows accretion flows to have some energy dissipation at the shock (Delta epsilon). As the dissipation is increased, the parameter space is reduced and finally disappears when the dissipation reaches a critical value. The dissipation has a profound effect on the dynamics of post-shock flow. By moving forward, an unstable shock, the oscillation of which causes quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the emitted radiation, will produce oscillations of high frequency. Such an evolution of QPOs has been observed in several black hole candidates during their outbursts.

AB We investigate the environment of the nearby (d approximate to 40 Mpc) broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) 2009bb. This event was observed to produce a relativistic outflow likely powered by a central accreting compact object. While such a phenomenon was previously observed only in long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), no LGRB was detected in association with SN 2009bb. Using an optical spectrum of the SN 2009bb explosion site, we determine a variety of interstellar medium properties for the host environment, including metallicity, young stellar population age, and star formation rate. We compare the SN explosion site properties to observations of LGRB and broad-lined SN Ic host environments on optical emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams. Based on these analyses, we find that the SN 2009bb explosion site has a metallicity between 1.7 Z(circle dot) and 3.5 Z(circle dot), in agreement with other broad-lined SN Ic host environments and at odds with the low-redshift LGRB host environments and recently proposed maximum metallicity limits for relativistic explosions. We consider the implications of these findings and the impact that SN 2009bb's unusual explosive properties and environment have on our understanding of the key physical ingredient that enables some SNe to produce a relativistic outflow.

AB The effect of cosmic string on the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of massless Dirac field perturbations were studied in different black hole space times. Quasi-normal mode frequencies of massless Dirac field in Schwarzschild, RN extremal, SdS and near extremal SdS black hole spacetimes with cosmic string are obtained using WKB approximation. Our study shows a clear deviation in QNMs due to presence of cosmic string from those in the absence of string. The influence of cosmic string coded in the form of an increase in the oscillation frequency and damping time of QNMs.

AB The solar wind impacting at the geomagnetopause contains transient variations in the embedded interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). These disturbances are mirrored in the horizontal geomagnetic field measured at the Huancayo and Ascension Island stations. This investigation attempts to relate the microtemporal fluctuations in the IMF with the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field by means of a newly developed daily vertical variance index, which permits the quantification of such pulsations. A linear relationship is established between the disturbances observed in the interplanetary and terrestrial fields on a daily basis.

AB To study the variation of ionospheric electron and ion temperatures with solar activity the data of electron and ion temperatures were recorded with the help of Retarding Potential Analyzer payload aboard Indian SROSS-C2 satellite at an average altitude of similar to 500 km. The main focuses of the paper is to see the diurnal, seasonal and latitudinal variations of electron and ion temperatures during periods of minimum to maximum solar activity. The ionospheric temperatures in the topside show strong variations with altitude, latitude, season and solar activity. In present study, the temperature variations with latitude, season and solar activity have been studied at an average altitude similar to 500 km. The peak at sunrise has been observed during all seasons, in both electron and ion temperatures. Further, the ionospheric temperatures vary with latitude in day time. The latitudinal variation is more pronounced for low solar activity than for high solar activity. (C) 2009 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper summarizes and provides a critical analysis of the historical developments of lunar gravitational models from the earliest use of ground based tracking systems of the Lunar Orbiter to the Lunar Prospector mission. This encompasses a comprehensive and critical analysis of the various methods used in the estimation of the gravity coefficients and the processing of large batches of diverse measurements and data types. It has been shown that weakness exists in the current models of the lunar gravity field, which is primarily due to the lack of far side lunar tracking data information, which makes the lunar potential modeling difficult but expected to be overcome as data from SELENE satellite-to-satellite tracking becomes available. Comparisons of various lunar models reveal an agreement in the low order coefficients of the spherical harmonics. However, substantial differences in the models exist in the higher-order harmonics. A numerical comparison has been presented showing the performance of all the contemporary lunar gravitational models used within the astrodynamics community and available in public domain. Improvements to the current models are part of a continuing process and the recent model improvements and future possibilities in lunar gravity modeling are discussed. A brief review of the recent missions has been presented. It is hoped that this critical review will benefit the researchers by presenting the historical as well as state of the art in this field.

AB The stable configurations of nonrotating and rotating hybrid stars composed of color-superconducting quark matter cores are constructed using several equations of state (EOSs). We use a set of diverse EOSs for the nuclear matter which represents the low density phase. The EOSs at higher densities correspond to the quark matter in the color-superconducting phase and are computed within the Nambu-Jona-Lasiniolike model for different values of the scalar diquark and vector current couplings strengths. The phase transition to the quark matter is computed by a Maxwell construction. We find that the stability of the hybrid stars are mainly governed by the behavior of the EOSs for the color-superconducting quark matter. However the compositions of hybrid stars are sensitive to the EOS of the nuclear matter. The value of the critical rotation frequency for the hybrid star depends strongly on the EOS of the nuclear matter as well as that for the color-superconducting quark matter. Our results indicate that the EOS for the color-superconducting quark matter can be obtained, by adjusting the parameters of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, to yield the stable configurations of the hybrid star having the maximum mass similar to 1.5M(circle dot) in the nonrotating limit and the critical rotation frequency similar to 1 kHz.

AB We consider a Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi type space-time in Einstein gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet combination of quadratic curvature terms, and present an exact solution in closed form. It turns out that the presence of the coupling constant of the Gauss-Bonnet terms alpha > 0 completely changes the causal structure of the singularities from the analogous general relativistic case. The gravitational collapse of inhomogeneous dust in the five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet extended Einstein equations leads to formation of a massive, but weak, timelike singularity which is forbidden in general relativity. Interestingly, this is a counterexample to three conjectures, viz., cosmic censorship conjecture, hoop conjecture, and Seifert's conjecture.

ID STRING THEORY; DIMENSIONS; STATES; FIELD
AB We investigate the properties of the event horizon and static limit for a charged rotating black hole solution of minimal supergravity theory in (1 + 4) dimension. Unlike the four-dimensional case, there are in general two rotations, and they couple to both mass and charge. This gives rise to much richer structure to ergosphere leading to energy extraction even for axial fall. Another interesting feature is that the metric in this case is sensitive to the sign of the Maxwell charge.

AB We present the results of the photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of the luminous Ap star HD 103498. The time-series photometric observations were carried out on 17 nights using a three-channel fast photometer attached to the 1.04-m optical telescope at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital. The photometric data from five nights in 2007 show a clear signature of 15-min periodicity. However, the follow-up observations during 2007-2009 did not reproduce any such periodicity. To confirm the photometric light variations, time-series spectroscopic observations were carried out with the 2.56-m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) at La Palma on 2009 February 2. No radial velocity variations were present in this data set, which is in full agreement with the photometric observations taken around the same date. Model atmosphere and abundance analysis of HD 103498 show that the star is evolved from the main sequence and its atmospheric abundances are similar to those of two other evolved Ap stars, HD 133792 and HD 204411: large overabundances of Si, Cr and Fe and moderate overabundances of the rare-earth elements. These chemical properties and a higher effective temperature distinguish HD 103498 from any known roAp star.

More specifically, we consider a dynamical three-brane in the background of Born-Infeld and electrically charged Gauss-Bonnet black hole. We find that, in certain range of parameter space, the brane universe, at least classically, never shrinks to a zero size, resulting in a singularity-free cosmology within the classical domain.

Our main goal is to present solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, to give their interpretation and to derive Hawking radiation from them. We restrict ourselves to a discussion of those points that are different from the Lambda = 0-case. These are mainly to do with the occurrence of two horizons.

AB Coordinated measurements of Indian MST radar and radiosonde during the passage of overshooting convective cores in SAFAR pilot campaign (May-November 2008) are utilized to quantify the mass flux across the tropopause and strength of the turbulence in up- and down-draft cores. The distribution of retrieved mass flux is found to be wide, ranging from -0.6 ( downward flux) to 0.8 kg m(-2) s(-1) ( upward flux). The net mass flux, is, however, from the troposphere to stratosphere, in spite of the existence of significant amount of downward flux. For the first time, the turbulence strength in the vicinity of the tropopause in convective cores is quantified. Large spectral widths with magnitudes >4 m s(-1) are observed during convection. However, such large spectral widths are rare and are observed only for 1.6% of total observations. The average spectral width ( and also the variation or standard deviation) in draft cores is found to be similar to 4.5 times larger than that in fair-weather. The turbulence strength in updraft cores is much higher than that of in down-draft cores. The mean ( median) spectral width in updraft cores is larger by similar to 0.8 m s(-1) ( a factor of similar to 2) than that of in down-draft cores. The turbulence strength does not show any systematic variation with the intensity of convection in both up- and down-draft cores. The distributions and mean values of mass flux and turbulence strength obtained in the present study will be useful to quantify the STE due to direct intrusion of mass by overshooting convection and the exchange of constituents ( in particular water vapor) due to turbulence in a better way.

The most extended view during filament eruptions is seen in He II 304 angstrom observations, as the filament spine appears darker and sharper. The projected filament width appears differently when viewed from different angles by STEREO satellites. Here, we present a method for estimating the width and inclination of the filament sheet using He II 304 angstrom observations by STEREO-A and B satellites from the two viewpoints. The width of the filament sheet, when measured from its feet to its apex, gives estimate of filament height above the chromosphere.

AB Coronal Mass ejections (CMEs) are enormous eruptions of magnetized plasma expelled from the Sun into the interplanetary space, over the course of hours to days. They can create major disturbances in the interplanetary medium and trigger severe magnetic storms when they collide with the Earth's magnetosphere. It is important to know their real speed, propagation direction and 3-D configuration in order to accurately predict their arrival time at the Earth. Using data from the SECCHI coronagraphs onboard the STEREO mission, which was launched in October 2006, we can infer the propagation direction and the 3-D structure of such events. In this review, we first describe different techniques that were used to model the 3-D configuration of CMEs in the coronagraph field of view ( up to 15 R-circle dot). Then, we apply these techniques to different CMEs observed by various coronagraphs. A comparison of results obtained from the application of different reconstruction algorithms is presented and discussed.

AB Study on daytime descending intermediate layer over subtropical Indian station Waltair (17.7 degrees N, 83.3 degrees E geographic, 6.4 degrees N, 10 degrees E geomagnetic, 20 degrees N dip) located in the equatorial anomaly transition region, using an IPS 42 Digital Ionosonde during the low solar activity year 2004 showed that the layers occur in the altitude range of 140-160 km with maximum occurrence during winter solstice. The layers observed during daytime occur with a double peak variation throughout the year with less occurrence probability and shorter duration presence during forenoon hours. The morning layer descent was associated with a density increase where as during afternoon hours a decrease in density was observed. The downward drift velocity was about 8 km/h during morning hours and between 7-11 km/h during afternoon hours, with a low descent rate of around 4.5 km/h during summer morning hours. The results indicate the presence of a 6 h tide at this location as observed from the characteristics of the descending layers, unlike at majority of locations where a significant semi diurnal trend is observed. The study brings out the complex nature of the tidal interaction at different locations.

AB The present study examines the process of how tropospheric air enters the stratosphere, particularly in association with tropical mesoscale convective systems (TMCS) which are considered to be one of the causative mechanisms for the observation of extremely low tropopause temperature over the tropics. The association between the phenomena of convection and the observation of extreme low tropopause temperature events is, therefore, examined over the Asian monsoon region using data from multiple platforms. Satellite observations show that the area of low outgoing long wave radiation (OLR), which is a proxy for the enhanced convection, is embedded with high altitude clouds top temperatures (< 193 K). A detailed analysis of OLR and 100 hPa temperature shows that both are modulated by westward propagating Rossby waves with a period of similar to 15 days, indicating a close linkage between them. The process by which the tropospheric air enters the stratosphere may, in turn, be determined by how the areas of convection and low tropopause temperature (LTT) i.e. T < 191 K are spatially located. In this context, the relative spatial distribution of low OLR and LTT areas is examined. Though, the locations of low OLR and LTT are noticed in the same broad area, the two do not always overlap, except for partial overlap in some cases. When there are multiple low OLR areas, the LTT area generally appears in between the low OLR areas. Implications of these observations are also discussed. The present analysis also shows that the horizontal mean winds have a role in the spatial distribution of low OLR and LTT.

AB In this paper, we present the effect of total solar eclipse on surface O-3, NO, NO2, NH3, CO mixing ratio and the meteorological parameters on 15 January 2010 at Thiruvanathapuram, India. On the day of total solar eclipse (i.e., 15 January 2010), the decrease in mixing ratio of surface O-3 and NO2 is observed after the beginning of the solar eclipse events (11:15 to 15:30). Decrease in surface O-3 may be due to decreased efficiency of the photochemical ozone formation, whereas, mixing ratio of NO and NH3 have been changed following the night time chemistry. Surface O-3 reduced to 20.3 ppb after 22 min of full phase of the eclipse. During the solar eclipse period, the ambient temperature and wind speed have decreased, whereas, relative humidity has increased as expected.

AB High-resolution radiosondes and calibrated radars operating close to 50 MHz, are used to examine the relationship between the strength of radar scatter and refractive index gradient. Three radars are used, in Kiruna in Arctic Sweden, at Gadanki in southern India and at the Swedish/Finnish base Wasa/Aboa in Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. Calibration is accomplished using the daily variation of galactic noise measured at each site. Proportionality between radar scatter strength and the square of the mean gradient of potential refractive index, M(2), is found in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere at all three sites, confirming previously reported results from many VHF radars. If the radar scatter is interpreted as Fresnel scatter, the constant of proportionality between radar scatter and M(2) is found to be the same, within the calibration uncertainties, for all three radars. The radiosondes show evidence of distinct layering with sharp gradients, extending over 10s of kilometers horizontally, but the scatter is found to be two orders of magnitude weaker than would be expected from true Fresnel scatter from such layers. Using radar reflectivities resolved to a few 100 ms, we show that this is due to strong temporal variability in the scattering conditions, possibly due to undulations of the scattering layers. The constancy of the radar scatter - M(2) relationship between the different sites suggests an unexpected uniformity in these perturbations between very different regions of the globe.

AB This paper presents measurement of daytime Sodium (Na) airglow emissions at 589.6 nm wavelength using a ground based 1-m scanning monochromator from Trivandrum (8.5 degrees N, 77 degrees E, 0.5 degrees N dip latitude), a near-equatorial station in India. The Na emission intensity exhibits significant temporal variability within a day and from one day to another. The Na intensity has been compared with the daytime OH airglow intensity at 731.6 nm simultaneously measured using the unique Multiwavelength Dayglow Photometer (MWDPM). The temporal variabilities of the Na and OH intensities corroborate each other in most of the occasions without any appreciable time delay, although a small time delay up to similar to 10 min has been observed at times. It appears that the variability of daytime Na emissions is influenced too by the photo-chemical excitations. The observed similarities in the Na and OH intensities are believed to be due to the similar roles played by [O] and O(3) (in their photochemical excitations) and the dynamics occurring at about the same altitude region (similar to 90 km). It has also been found that the gravity waves play significant role in producing the short-scale oscillations in these emissions.

AB We develop a new model of the fluctuation dynamo in which the magnetic field is confined to thin flux ropes advected by a multi-scale flow which models turbulence. Magnetic dissipation occurs only via reconnections of flux ropes. The model is particularly suitable for rarefied plasma, such as the solar corona or galactic halos. We investigate the kinetic energy release into heat, mediated by dynamo action, both in our model and by solving the induction equation with the same flow. We find that the flux rope dynamo is more than an order of magnitude more efficient at converting mechanical energy into heat. The probability density of the magnetic energy released during reconnections has a power-law form with the slope -3, consistent with the solar corona heating by nanoflares. We also present a nonlinear extension of the model. This shows that a plausible saturation mechanism of the fluctuation dynamo is the suppression of turbulent magnetic diffusivity, due to suppression of random stretching at the location of the flux ropes. We confirm that the probability distribution function of the magnetic line curvature has a power-law form suggested by Schekochihin et al. (2002c). We argue, however, using our results that this does not imply a persistent folded structure of magnetic field, at least in the nonlinear stage. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB I present a review of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in a strongly magnetised plasma. The approach is phenomenological even where a more rigorous theory is available, so that a reader armed with paper, pencil and some determination may be able to work through most of the physics. The focus is on the inertial-range spectra for very large (fluid and magnetic) Reynolds numbers. These theories of the inertial-range are built on two important facts: (i) Kraichnan's insight that the turbulent cascades are a result of nonlinear interactions between oppositely directed wavepackets of Elsasser fields; (ii) these oppositely directed wavepackets do not exchange energy, but contribute only to changing each other's spatial structures. I begin with a description and critique of the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan theory, and explore the fundamental departures necessitated by the anisotropic nature of the turbulence. Derivations of the inertial-range spectra of four regimes of MHD turbulence - the balanced weak, balanced strong, imbalanced weak and the imbalanced strong cascades - are then presented. The need for studying the spectra of imbalanced turbulence when the waves on the outer scale have a short correlation time is briefly discussed. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

We first focus on how to formulate electrodynamics in curved space time, defining appropriate magnetic and electric fields and writing Maxwell equations in terms of these fields. We then specialize to the case of magnetohydrodynamics in the expanding Universe. We emphasize the usefulness of tetrads in this context. We then review the generation of magnetic fields during the inflationary era, deriving in detail the predicted magnetic and electric spectra for some models. We discuss potential problems arising from back reaction effects and from the large variation of the coupling constants required for such field generation. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB Aims. We seek the long-term variations close to the length of a solar cycle in the mean meridional motion of sunspot groups (a proxy of the meridional plasma flow).
   Methods. Using the largest set of available reliable sunspot group data, the combined Greenwich and Solar Optical Observation Network sunspot group data during the period 1879-2008, we determined variations in the mean meridional motion of the sunspot groups in the Sun's whole northern and southern hemispheres and also in different 10 degrees latitude intervals. We determined the variations from the yearly data and for the sake of better statistics by binning the data into 3-4 year moving time intervals (MTIs) successively shifted by one year. We determined the periodicities in the mean meridional motion from the fast Fourier transform (FFT) power spectrum analysis. The values of the periodicities are determined from the maximum entropy method (MEM) and the temporal dependencies of the periodicities are determined from the Morlet-wavelet analyses.
   Results. We find that the mean meridional motion of the spot groups varies considerably on a time scale of about 5-20 years. The maximum amplitude of the variation is about 10-15 ms(-1) in both the northern and the southern hemispheres. Variation in the mean motion is considerably different during different solar cycles. At the maximum epoch (year 2000) of the current cycle 23, the mean motion is relatively strong in the past 100 years and northbound in both the northern and the southern hemispheres. This abnormal behavior of the mean motion may be related to the low strength and the long duration of the current cycle, and also to the violation of the Gnevyshev and Ohl rule by the cycles pair 22, 23. The power spectral analyses suggest the existence of approximate to 3.2- and approximate to 4.3-year periodicities in the mean motion of the spot groups in the southern hemisphere, whereas a 13-16 year periodicity is found to exist in the mean motion of the northern hemisphere. There is strong evidence for a latitude-time dependency in the periodicities of the mean motion. The north-south difference in the mean motion also varies by about 10 ms(-1). During the recent cycles, the north-south difference is negligibly small. Approximate 12- and 22-year periodicities are found to exist in the north-south difference. The implications of all these results are briefly discussed.

AB Aims. We aim to develop a method to determine distances to molecular clouds using JHK near-infrared photometry.
   Methods. The method is based on a technique that aids spectral classification of stars lying towards the fields containing the clouds into main sequence and giants. In this technique, the observed (J-H) and (H-K(s)) colours are dereddened simultaneously using trial values of A(V) and a normal interstellar extinction law. The best fit of the dereddened colours to the intrinsic colours giving a minimum value of chi(2) then yields the corresponding spectral type and A(V) for the star. The main sequence stars, thus classified, are then utilized in an A(V) versus distance plot to bracket the cloud distances.
   Results. We applied the method to four clouds, L1517, Chamaeleon I, Lupus 3 and NGC 7023 and estimated their distances as 167 +/- 30, 151 +/- 28, 157 +/- 29 and 408 +/- 76 pc respectively, which are in good agreement with the previous distance estimations available in the literature.

AB In the past, there have been reports of the observation of decrease in the flux of secondary cosmic gamma-rays during a total solar eclipse. We have measured the flux of secondary cosmic gamma-rays during the total solar eclipse that occurred at Novosibirsk in Russia, on 1 August 2008. Highly sensitive measurements were carried out by using a detector system with built-in redundancy. The system consisted of two independent, large volume Nal(Tl) scintillator detectors for sensitive and reliable measurements. The data display significant variability in the flux of secondary gamma-rays in the energy range 50-4600 keV. just prior to the total solar eclipse a change similar to 9% in the flux was observed, followed by a small but steady decrease similar to 4% during the eclipse. The temporal variation in the observed flux of gamma-rays were found to be nearly identical for the two detectors. The energy dependence of the variation was further studied by binning the yield in three energy ranges, namely, 100-200, 200-400 and 400-4600 keV. The nearly identical time variation observed in the two independent measurements provides confidence that the measured variation is real and not an artifact of the instrumentation. Systematic observations during the future eclipses are required to study this fascinating phenomenon which is not yet understood. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quasi-periodic oscillations in the speed profile of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the radial distance range 2-30 solar radii are studied. We considered the height-time data of the 307 CMEs recorded by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) during 2005 January-March. In order to study the speed-distance profile of the CMEs, we have used only 116 events for which there are at least 10 height-time measurements made in the LASCO field of view. The instantaneous CME speed is estimated using a pair of height-time data points, providing the speed-distance profile. We found quasi-periodic patterns in at least 15 speed-distance profiles, where the speed amplitudes are larger than the speed errors. For these events we have determined the speed amplitude and period of oscillations. The periods of quasi-periodic oscillations are found in the range 48-240 minutes, tending to increase with height. The oscillations have similar properties as those reported by Krall et al., who interpreted them in terms of the flux-rope model. The nature of forces responsible for the motion of CMEs and their oscillations are discussed.

AB The accretion disk around a compact object is a nonlinear general relativistic system involving magnetohydrodynamics. Naturally, the question arises whether such a system is chaotic (deterministic) or stochastic (random) which might be related to the associated transport properties whose origin is still not confirmed. Earlier, the black hole system GRS 1915+105 was shown to be low-dimensional chaos in certain temporal classes. However, so far such nonlinear phenomena have not been studied fairly well for neutron stars which are unique for their magnetosphere and kHz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). On the other hand, it was argued that the QPO is a result of nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic effects in accretion disks. If a neutron star exhibits chaotic signature, then what is the chaotic/correlation dimension? We analyze RXTE/PCA data of neutron stars Sco X-1 and Cyg X-2, along with the black hole Cyg X-1 and the unknown source Cyg X-3, and show that while Sco X-1 and Cyg X-2 are low dimensional chaotic systems, Cyg X-1 and Cyg X-3 are stochastic sources. Based on our analysis, we argue that Cyg X-3 may be a black hole.

AB Empirical evidence for both stellar mass black holes (M (aEuro cent)< 10(2) M (aS (TM))) and supermassive black holes (SMBHs, M (aEuro cent)> 10(5) M (aS (TM))) is well established. Moreover, every galaxy with a bulge appears to host a SMBH, whose mass is correlated with the bulge mass, and even more strongly with the central stellar velocity dispersion sigma (c) , the M (aEuro cent)-sigma relation. On the other hand, evidence for "intermediate-mass" black holes (IMBHs, with masses in the range 100-10(5) M (aS (TM))) is relatively sparse, with only a few mass measurements reported in globular clusters (GCs), dwarf galaxies and low-mass AGNs. We explore the question of whether globular clusters extend the M (aEuro cent)-sigma relationship for galaxies to lower black hole masses and find that available data for globular clusters are consistent with the extrapolation of this relationship. We use this extrapolated M (aEuro cent)-sigma relationship to predict the putative black hole masses of those globular clusters where existence of central IMBH was proposed. We discuss how globular clusters can be used as a constraint on theories making specific predictions for the low-mass end of the M (aEuro cent)-sigma relation.

AB Spatially homogeneous and anisotropic LRS Bianchi type-I string cosmological models are studied in the frame work of general relativity when the source for the energy momentum tensor is a bulk viscous fluid containing one dimensional strings. A barotropic equation of state for the pressure and density is assumed to get determinate solutions of the field equations. The bulk viscous pressure is assumed to be proportional to the energy density. The physical and kinematical properties of the models are discussed. The role of bulk viscosity in getting an inflationary phase in the universe is studied.

The nature and role of the metric rotation Omega(r,t) as well as that of the matter rotation omega(r,t) are studied for uniform and non-uniform motions. The reactions of the gravitational and charged fields with respect to the rotational motion are studied and possible results are explored for real astrophysical situations, and in some solutions we find the spatial restrictions on the models for realistic conditions. Rotating models which are expanding are obtained in which the rotational motions are decaying with time.

AB We investigate the spacetime of anisotropic stars admitting conformal motion. The Einstein field equations are solved using different ansatz of the surface tension. In this investigation, we study two cases in details with the anisotropy as: (1) p(t) = np(r), (2) p(t) - p(r) = 1/8 pi (c(1)/r(2) + c(2)) where, n, c(1) and c(2) are arbitrary constants. The solutions yield expressions of the physical quantities like pressure gradients and the mass.

AB A simple quantum gravity model, based on a new conjecture within the canonically quantized 3 + 1 general relativity, is presented. The conjecture states that matter fields are functionals of an embedding volume form only and reduces the quantum geometrodynamics. By dimensional reduction the resulting theory is presented in the form of the Dirac equation, and application of the Fock quantization with the diagonalization procedure yields construction of the appropriate quantum field theory. The 1D wave function is derived, the corresponding 3-dimensional manifolds are discussed as well as physical scales associated with quantum correlations.

AB Kaluza-Klein (KK) black hole solutions in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity in D dimensions obtained in the current series of the works by Maeda, Dadhich and Molina are examined. Interpreting their solutions, the authors claim that mass/matter is created by the extra dimensions. To support this claim, one needs to show that such objects have classically defined masses. We calculate the mass and mass flux for 3D KK black holes in 6D EGB gravity whose properties are sufficiently physically interesting. Superpotentials for arbitrary types of perturbations on arbitrary curved backgrounds, recently obtained by the author, are used, and acceptable mass and mass flux are obtained. A possibility of considering the KK created matter as dark matter in the Universe is discussed.

Particle production of a nonclassical scalar field in the coherent and squeezed state formalisms in the open FRW universe is examined. Numerical solutions to the semiclassical Friedmann equations are obtained for both the closed and open models in the coherent and squeezed state formalisms.

AB We propose a model of inflation with a suitable potential for a single scalar field which falls in the wide class of hilltop inflation. We derive the analytical expressions for most of the physical quantities related to inflation and show that all of them represent the true behavior as required from a model of inflation. We further subject the results to observational verification by formulating the theory of perturbations based on our model followed by an estimation for the values of those observable parameters. Our model is found to be in excellent agreement with observational data. Thus, the features related to the model leads us to infer that this type of hilltop inflation may be a natural choice for explaining the early universe.

AB Precision measurements of neutron star radii can provide a powerful probe of the properties of cold matter beyond nuclear density. Beginning in the late 1970s, it was proposed that the radius could be obtained from the apparent or inferred emitting area during the decay portions of thermonuclear (type I) X-ray bursts. However, this apparent area is generally not constant, preventing a reliable measurement of the source radius. Here, we report for the first time a correlation between the variation of the inferred area and the burst properties, measured in a sample of almost 900 bursts from 43 sources. We found that the rate of change of the inferred area during decay is anticorrelated with the burst decay duration. A Spearman rank correlation test shows that this relation is significant at the < 10-45 level for our entire sample, and at the 7 x 10-37 level for the 625 bursts without photospheric radius expansion. This anticorrelation is also highly significant for individual sources exhibiting a wide range of burst durations, such as 4U 1636-536 and Aql X-1. We suggest that variations in the colour factor, which relates the colour temperature resulted from the scattering in the neutron star atmosphere to the effective temperature of the burning layer, may explain the correlation. This in turn implies significant variations in the composition of the atmosphere between bursts with long and short durations.

AB We present optical spectroscopic identifications of X-ray sources in similar to 3 deg2 of the XMM-Large Scale Structure survey (XMM-LSS), also covered by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), obtained with the AAOmega instrument at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. In a flux-limited sample of 829 point-like sources in the optical band with g' < 22 mag and the 0.5-2 keV flux (f(0.5-2 keV)) > 1 x 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1, we observed 693 objects and obtained reliable spectroscopic identification for 487 sources, approximately 59 per cent of the overall sample. We therefore increase the number of identifications in this field by a factor close to 5. Galactic stellar sources represent about 15 per cent of the total (74/487). About 54 per cent (265/487) are broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) spanning redshifts between 0.15 and 3.87 with a median value of 1.68. The optical-to-X-ray spectral index (alpha(ox)) of the broad-line AGN is 1.47 +/- 0.03, typical of optically selected type I quasars, and is found to correlate with the rest-frame X-ray and optical monochromatic luminosities at 2 keV and 2500 A, respectively. Consistent with previous studies, we find alpha(ox) not to be correlated with z. In addition, 32 and 116 X-ray sources are, respectively, absorption- and emission-line galaxies at z < 0.76. From a line ratio diagnostic diagram, it is found that in about 50 per cent of these emission-line galaxies, the emission lines are powered significantly by the AGN. 30 of the XMM sources are detected at one or more radio frequencies. In addition, 24 sources have ambiguous identification: in eight cases, two XMM sources have a single optical source within 6 arcsec of each of them, whereas two and 14 XMM sources have, respectively, three and two possible optical sources within 6 arcsec of each of them. Spectra of multiple possible counterparts were obtained in such ambiguous cases.

We use morphological parameters derived from two-dimensional bulge-disc decomposition to study the evolution. We find an increase in the mean bulge-to-total luminosity ratio as the Universe evolves. We also find a corresponding increase in the fraction of early-type galaxies and in the mean Sersic index. We discuss these results and their implications to physical mechanisms for evolution of galaxy morphology.

AB We study intensity oscillations near the apex of a coronal loop to find the signature of MHD oscillations. We analyse the time series of the strongest Fe XII 195.12 angstrom image data, observed by 40 '' SLOT of the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard the Hinode spacecraft. Using a standard wavelet tool, we produce power spectra of intensity oscillations at location 'L-3' near the apex of a clearly visible coronal loop. We detect intensity oscillations of a period of approximate to 322 s with a probability of 96%. This oscillation period of approximate to 322 s is found to be in good agreement with theory of the (second) harmonics of standing slow acoustic oscillations of P-2nd (slow) approximate to 313 +/- 31 s. We detect, for the first time, the observational signature of multiple (first and second) harmonics of slow acoustic oscillations in the non-flaring coronal loop. Such oscillations have been observed in the past in hot and flaring coronal loops only, but have been predicted recently to exist in comparatively cooler and non-flaring coronal loops as well. We find the periodicities similar to 497 s and similar to 592 s with the probability 99-100% at the 'L-1' and 'L-2' locations, respectively, near the clearly visible western footpoint of the loop. We interpret these oscillations to be likely associated with the first harmonics (fundamental mode) of slow acoustic oscillations. Using the period ratios P-1/P-2 = 1.54 and 1.84, we estimate the density scale heights in the EUV loop as similar to 10 Mm and 21 Mm, respectively, in which the latter value (similar to 21 Mm) is compared well with the loop half length. We also find an evidence of propagating bright blob at its lower bound sub-sonic speed of approximate to 6.4 km/s, suggesting that they are caused by the mass flow from one end to the other in the coronal loop. We also suggest that standing oscillations, and propagating bright blobs caused probably by the pulse of plasma flow, co-exist in comparatively cooler and non-flaring coronal loop.

AB We study the energetics of the accretion-induced outflow and then plausible jet around black holes/compact objects using a newly developed disc-outflow coupled model. Inter-connecting dynamics of outflow and accretion essentially upholds the conservation laws. The energetics depend strongly on the viscosity parameter a and the cooling factor f which exhibit several interesting features. The bolometric luminosities of ultra-luminous X-ray binaries (e.g. SS433) and family of highly luminous AGNs and quasars can be reproduced by the model under the super-Eddington accretion flows. Under appropriate conditions, low-luminous AGNs (e.g. Sagittarius A*) also fit reasonably well with the luminosity corresponding to a sub-Eddington accretion flow with f -> 1. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB We model the shape and density profile of the dark matter halo of the low surface brightness, superthin galaxy UGC 7321, using the observed rotation curve and the Hi scale height data as simultaneous constraints. We treat the galaxy as a gravitationally coupled system of stars and gas, responding to the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo. An isothermal halo of spherical shape with a core density in the range of 0.039-0.057 M(circle dot) pc(-3) and a core radius between 2.5 and 2.9 kpc, gives the best fit to the observations for a range of realistic gas parameters assumed. We find that the best-fit core radius is only slightly higher than the stellar disc scale length (2.1 kpc), unlike the case of the high surface brightness galaxies where the halo core radius is typically 3-4 times the disc scale length of the stars. Thus our model shows that the dark matter halo dominates the dynamics of the low surface brightness, superthin galaxy UGC 7321 at all radii, including the inner parts of the galaxy.

AB We show that the northern middle radio lobe of Cen A, an intriguing and much debated manifestation of radio lobe asymmetry, can be understood in terms of a direct interaction of the northern jet with a gaseous cloud associated with a stellar shell. This same basic mechanism was proposed earlier for the northern inner lobe, but new data allows a more detailed case to be made for the northern middle lobe. Although such an interaction can presently be demonstrated only for Cen A, the nearest radio galaxy, it is likely to be a fairly common occurrence and it provides an alternative to models invoking episodic nuclear activity, possibly accompanied with jet precession, for radio galaxies with multiple lobes and S-shapes. This proposed scenario may also play a key role in the origin of prominent radio galaxy morphological classes, such as the Wide-Angle-Tail sources and the Z-symmetric X-shaped radio sources. The strong tendency for radio lobes to be more distorted in double radio sources with jets that are in closer alignment with the optical major axis of the host elliptical galaxy can likewise be understood in terms of jet-shell interactions. In the frequent cases when jet activity is triggered by mergers of a large elliptical galaxy with a disk galaxy containing cold gas the impact of the gas associated with stellar shells upon the jets is likely to have significant manifestations.

AB The partially ionized part of the solar atmosphere is investigated within the framework of a single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description including the non-ideal effects such as the Hall effect and the ambipolar diffusion in the generalized Ohm's Law. In this paper, we study the propagation and damping of an Alfven-like mode in the partially ionized solar atmosphere. It is found that the Hall effect, in addition to introducing strong dispersion, breaks the symmetry between the co- and the counter-propagating wave modes at the length scale approaching the Hall length-scale. The Hall effect creates short wavelength mode with circular polarization. The damping of Alfven-like mode, in a partially ionized solar atmosphere, is found to be caused mainly by the Coulomb and the Cowling diffusivity. A comparison of the Hall (eta(H)), the Cowling (eta(A)) and the Coulomb (eta) diffusivities shows that the ambipolar effect is dominant beyond the height of 175 km above the solar surface, for the solar model given by Cox (2000) [Cox, A.N., 2000.

AB We derive the nonuniversal gaugino mass ratios in a supergravity (SUGRA) framework where the Higgs superfields belong to the nonsinglet representations 54 and 770 in an SO(10) grand unified theory (GUT). We evaluate the ratios for the phenomenologically viable intermediate breaking chain SU(4)(C) x SU(2)(L) x SU(2)(R)G(422)). After a full calculation of the gaugino mass ratios, noting some errors in the earlier calculation for 54, we obtain, using the renormalization group equations, interesting low scale phenomenology of such breaking patterns. Here, we assume the breaking of the SO(10) GUT group to the intermediate gauge group and that to the standard model take place at the GUT scale itself. We also study the collider signatures in multilepton channels at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for some selected benchmark points allowed by the cold dark-matter relic density constraint provided by the WMAP data and compare these results with the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) framework with similar gluino masses indicating their distinguishability in this regard.

ID COSMOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS; MODEL; TRANSITIONS; SYSTEMS
AB It is well known that the dynamics of a quantum system is always nonadiabatic in passage through a quantum critical point and the defect density in the final state following a quench shows a power-law scaling with the rate of quenching. However, we propose here a possible situation where the dynamics of a quantum system in passage across quantum critical regions is adiabatic and the defect density decays exponentially. This is achieved by incorporating additional interactions which lead to quantum critical behavior and gapless phases but do not participate in the time evolution of the system. To illustrate the general argument, we study the defect generation in the quantum critical dynamics of a spin-1/2 anisotropic quantum XY spin chain with three spin interactions and a linearly driven staggered magnetic field.

AB Fractional calculus and special functions have contributed a lot to mathematical physics and its various branches. The great use of mathematical physics in distinguished astrophysical problems has attracted astronomers and physicists to pay more attention to available mathematical tools that can be widely used in solving several problems of astrophysics/physics. In view of the great importance and usefulness of kinetic equations in certain astrophysical problems, the authors derive a generalized fractional kinetic equation involving the Lorenzo-Hartley function, a generalized function for fractional calculus. The fractional kinetic equation discussed here can be used to investigate a wide class of known (and possibly also new) fractional kinetic equations, hitherto scattered in the literature. A compact and easily computable solution is established in terms of the Lorenzo-Hartley function. Special cases, involving the generalized Mittag-Leffler function and the R-function, are considered. The obtained results imply the known results more precisely.

SO RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
DE atomic processes; line: formation; Sun: activity
ID QUIET-SUN; SOLAR; BALANCE
AB Comparison of appropriate theoretically derived line ratios with observational data can yield estimates of a plasma's physical parameters, such as electron density or temperature. The usual practice in the calculation of the line ratio is the assumption of excitation by electrons/protons followed by radiative decay. Furthermore, it is normal to use the so-called coronal approximation, i.e. one only considers ionization and recombination to and from the ground-state. A more accurate treatment is to include ionization/recombination to and from metastable levels. Here, we apply this to two lines from adjacent ionization stages, Mg IX 368 angstrom and Mg X 625 angstrom, which has been shown to be a very useful temperature diagnostic. At densities typical of coronal hole conditions, the difference between the electron temperature derived assuming the zero density limit compared with the electron density dependent ionization/recombination is small. This, however, is not the case for flares where the electron density is orders of magnitude larger. The derived temperature for the coronal hole at solar maximum is around 1.04 MK compared to just below 0.82 MK at solar minimum.

AB The geoeffective magnetic cloud (MC) of 20 November 2003 was associated with the 18 November 2003 solar active events in previous studies. In some of these, it was estimated that the magnetic helicity carried by the MC had a positive sign, as did its solar source, active region (AR) NOAA 10501. In this article we show that the large-scale magnetic field of AR 10501 has a negative helicity sign. Since coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are one of the means by which the Sun ejects magnetic helicity excess into interplanetary space, the signs of magnetic helicity in the AR and MC must agree. Therefore, this finding contradicts what is expected from magnetic helicity conservation. However, using, for the first time, correct helicity density maps to determine the spatial distribution of magnetic helicity injections, we show the existence of a localized flux of positive helicity in the southern part of AR 10501. We conclude that positive helicity was ejected from this portion of the AR leading to the observed positive helicity MC.

AB In the present study, the short-term periodicities in the daily data of the sunspot numbers and areas are investigated separately for the full disk, northern, and southern hemispheres during Solar Cycle 23 for a time interval from 1 January 2003 to 30 November 2007 corresponding to the descending and minimum phase of the cycle. The wavelet power spectrum technique exhibited a number of quasi-periodic oscillations in all the datasets. In the high frequency range, we find a prominent period of 22 -aEuro parts per thousand 35 days in both sunspot indicators. Other quasi-periods in the range of 40 -aEuro parts per thousand 60, 70 -aEuro parts per thousand 90, 110 -aEuro parts per thousand 130, 140 -aEuro parts per thousand 160, and 220 -aEuro parts per thousand 240 days are detected in the sunspot number time series in different hemispheres at different time intervals. In the sunspot area data, quasi-periods in the range of 50 -aEuro parts per thousand 80, 90 -aEuro parts per thousand 110, 115 -aEuro parts per thousand 130, 140 -aEuro parts per thousand 155, 160 -aEuro parts per thousand 190, and about 230 days were noted in different hemispheres within the time period of analysis. The present investigation shows that the well-known "Rieger periodicity" of 150 -aEuro parts per thousand 160 days reappears during the descending phase of Solar Cycle 23, but this is prominent mainly in the southern part of the Sun. Possible explanations of these observed periodicities are delivered on the basis of earlier results detected in photospheric magnetic field time series (Knaack, Stenflo, and Berdyugina in Astron. Astrophys. 438, 1067, 2005) and solar r-mode oscillations.

We show that null naked singularities that form in such a collapse can never be observed. No energy can come out of these singularities; thus they will have no physical consequences outside. As this happens for any null singularity, we do not need to assume specific form of matter and establish role of initial data. Hence our result is very general.

AB We analyze warm tachyonic inflation, proposed in the literature, from the viewpoint of four-dimensional effective action for the tachyon field on a non-BPS D3-brane. We find that consistency with observational data on density perturbation and validity of effective action requires warped compactification. The number of background branes which source the flux is found to be of the order of 10, in contrast to the order of 10(14) in the standard cold inflationary scenario.

We examine the. ne structure of gravitational bending in new light to obtain insights pertaining to some deep links between gravity and quantum mechanics. The new results include quantum-theoretical interpretation of part of the light bending, making a good case for gravity encompassing wave-particle duality, perhaps a new insight for quantum gravity itself. We reiterate the mutual compatibility of the equivalence principle and quantum dynamics in a simple proof. Finally, we address certain unresolved issues regarding the gravitational bending of ultraslow light and tunneling photons in the context of experiments that might pose fresh challenges for the interface of the two century-old theories.

We look at a unified picture of black hole entropy and curvature and how this can lead to the usual black hole luminosity due to Hawking radiation. It is also shown how the volume inside the horizon, apart from the surface area (hologram!), can play a role in understanding the Hawking flux. In addition, holography implies a phase space associated with the interior volume and this happens to be just a quantum of phase space, filled with just one photon. The generalized uncertainty principle can be incorporated in this analysis. These results hold for all black hole masses in any dimension.

TI WHAT IF THE INFLATON IS A SPINOR CONDENSATE?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D

DT Article
ID DIMENSIONS; MODELS
AB In the usual cosmological inflationary scenarios, the scalar field - the inflaton - is usually assumed to be an elementary field. In this essay, we ask: What are the observational signatures if the scalar field is a spinor condensate? And is there a way to distinguish between the canonical scalar field and the spinor-condensate-driven models? In the homogeneous and isotropic background, we show that - although the dark-spinor (Elko) condensate leads to an acceleration equation identical to that of the canonical-scalar-field-driven inflation - the dynamics of the two models are different. In the slow-roll limit, we show that the model predicts a running of the scalar spectral index consistent with the WMAP data. We show that the consistency relations between the spinor condensate and the canonical-scalar-field-driven model are different, which we will be able to test using the future CMB and gravitational wave missions.

AB I show that combining the principle of equivalence and the principle of general covariance with the known properties of local Rindler horizons, perceived by accelerated observers, leads to the following inescapable conclusion: The field equations describing gravity in any diffeomorphism-invariant theory must have a thermodynamic interpretation. This synthesis of quantum theory, thermodynamics and gravity shows that the gravitational dynamics can be interpreted completely in terms of entropy balance between matter and space-time. This idea has far-reaching implications for the microstructure of space-time and quantum gravity.

ID GLOBAL SURVEYOR; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE
AB We report the first model results of zonal wind perturbations in the nighttime D region ionosphere of Mars during winter and summer seasons at latitude ranges 60 degrees S-64 degrees S and 64.7 degrees N-67.3 degrees N, respectively. The production rate, ion density, and electron density are calculated between longitudes 0 degrees and 360 degrees E due to impact of galactic cosmic rays on the nighttime troposphere of Mars at these latitudes. In this calculation, temperature and air density are used from the measurements made by the radio occultation experiment on board Mars Global Surveyor at low solar activity period. In these seasons the zonal distribution of temperature, air density, and electron density are fitted by a least squares method at altitudes near the surface, 15 km and 30 km. The modes of seasonal winds are also calculated from Fourier analysis at these heights. These measurements suggest mode of wave number 2 in northern high latitudes and wave numbers 3 and 8 in southern high latitudes, respectively. It is found that the nighttime ionosphere of Mars consists of a permanent D peak, which varies with east longitudes in both hemispheres. The modes 2 and 3 of semidiurnal tides dominate the D peak oscillation during the summer and winter seasons, respectively. The water cluster ions H(3)O+(H(2)O)(n), NO(2)(-)(H(2)O)(n) and CO(3)(-)(H(2)O)(n) are the major species in the D region ionosphere of Mars.

AB Thin accretion discs around massive compact objects can support slow pressure modes of oscillations in the linear regime that have azimuthal wavenumber m = 1. We consider finite, flat discs composed of barotropic fluid for various surface density profiles and demonstrate - through WKB analysis and numerical solution of the eigenvalue problem - that these modes are stable and have spatial scales comparable to the size of the disc. We show that the eigenvalue equation can be mapped to a Schrodinger-like equation. The analysis of this equation shows that all eigenmodes have discrete spectra. We find that all the models we have considered support negative frequency eigenmodes; however, the positive eigenfrequency modes are only present in power-law discs, albeit for physically uninteresting values of the power-law index beta and barotropic index gamma.

AB The formation of the Sweet-Parker current sheet, in fact a slab, is studied for a partially ionized plasma. The effects arising from the ion-neutral drag, the ambipolar diffusion, the resistivity resulting from electron-neutral and electron-ion collisions, and the Hall electric field are important for determining the dimensions of the current slab as well as the magnetic reconnection rate. It is the Hall effect that transforms the sheet into a slab. Along with the slab configuration, the out-of-plane plasma flow generated jointly by the Hall and the ambipolar effects is an important signature result. Although the ambipolar effect enhances and the Hall effect depletes the reconnection rate, its quantitative estimate may, at best, be considered only a pointer, owing to the lack of information on the precise physical conditions near the reconnection region in astrophysical settings.

AB Quasi-periodic scintillations are characterized as primary deep fadeout in field strength, associated with regular ringing patterns before and after it. In this paper, observations of quasi-periodic scintillations using geostationary satellite (FLEETSAT) transmissions operating at frequency 250 MHz at low-latitude ground station, Varanasi (geomagnetic latitude 14 degrees 55'N, longitude 153 degrees 59'E), are reported. The results indicate that the quasi-periodic scintillations are most likely produced by plasma blobs/bubbles present in the E and F regions of the ionosphere which are helpful in identifying the generation mechanism of the associated irregularities. The various characteristic features of the different types of quasi-periodic scintillations observed at low latitude are discussed for the first time in detail based on a highly comprehensive analysis of longer data sets using autocorrelation, power spectrum, and scintillation index analysis. The computed horizontal scale size of the quasi-periodic scintillations producing irregularity varies from 100 to 1300 m which shows that the irregularities are of intermediate-scale sizes. The spectral index obtained from the slopes of power spectrum varies from -2 to -8. All of these observed results are important for identifying the generation mechanism of ionospheric irregularities associated with quasi-periodic scintillations. The observed fading patterns, especially the modulation of the diffraction patterns (fading envelopes), can be explained by considering an obstacle called radio lens in the ionosphere elongated in one direction. For the first time, we have successfully simulated the amplitude versus time plots of almost all types of quasi-periodic scintillation patches and found that our modeled and observed characteristics of quasi-periodic scintillation patches compare well with each other.

AB In this work, the stability of static solutions of spherical thin shell wormholes is analyzed when a slight perturbation (which preserves the basic symmetry) is applied to them. The modified Chaplygin gas (with alpha = 1 in the equation of state) has been chosen as a candidate for exotic matter needed around the throat. Different cases for such thin shell wormhole construction have been studied, viz. wormholes constructed from Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-de Sitter, Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom metrics. Depending upon the values of the parameters and some restrictions obeyed by them, static stable solutions are seen to exist in some cases.

AB We have calculated the effects of large-scale solar flows, such as the meridional circulation, giant convection cells, and solar rotation on the helioseismic splitting coefficients using quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (QDPT). Our investigation reveals that the effect of poloidal flows like the large-scale meridional circulation are difficult to detect in observational data of the global acoustic modes since the frequency shifts are much less than the errors. However, signatures of large-scale convective flows may be detected if their amplitude is sufficiently large by looking for frequency shifts due to nearly degenerate modes coupled by convection. In this comprehensive study, we attempt to put limits on the magnitude of flow velocities in giant cells by comparing the splitting coefficients obtained from the QDPT treatment with observational data.

AB While there have been multiple observational programs aimed at detecting linear polarization of optical radiation emitted by ultracool dwarfs, there has been comparatively less rigorous theoretical analysis of the problem. The general expectation has been that the atmospheres of those substellar-mass objects with condensate clouds would give rise to linear polarization due to scattering. Because of rotation-induced non-sphericity, there is expected to be incomplete cancellation of disk-integrated net polarization and thus a finite polarization. For cloudless objects, however, only molecular Rayleigh scattering will contribute to any net polarization and this limit has not been well studied. Hence in this paper we present a detailed multiple scattering analysis of the polarization expected from those T-dwarfs whose spectra show absence of condensates. For this, we develop and solve the full radiative transfer equations for linearly polarized radiation. Only atomic and molecular Rayleigh scattering are considered to be the sources of polarization. We compute the local polarization at different angular directions in a plane-parallel atmosphere calculated for the range of effective temperatures of T dwarfs and then average over the whole surface of the object. The effects of gravity and limb darkening as well as rotation induced non-sphericity are included. It is found that the amount of polarization decreases with the increase in effective temperature. It is also found that significant polarization at any local point in the atmosphere arises only in the optical (B band). However, the disk integrated polarization-even in the B band-is negligible. Hence we conclude that, unlike the case for cloudy L dwarfs, polarization of cloudless T dwarfs by atomic and molecular scattering may not be detectable. In the future we will extend this work to cloudy L and T dwarf atmospheres.

AB The response of the equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere-thermosphere system to the geomagnetic storm during 23-26 August 2005 is investigated. The study is carried out using the vertical total electron content (VTEC) measured by GPS receivers along the 77-78 degrees E longitude and the O/N-2 ratio obtained from the Global Ultraviolet Imager instrument on board the TIMED satellite. The equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) shows a poleward latitudinal expansion on 24 August, probably associated with an eastward prompt-penetration electric field. The equatorial and low latitudes show an increase in VTEC during the main phase of the storm on 24 August. The prompt-penetration eastward electric field, along with an increase in the O/N-2 ratio, could be responsible for this observed positive phase. The VTEC variations on 24 August also reveal the signature of a large-scale acoustic gravity wave/traveling atmospheric disturbance propagating with a horizontal velocity of similar to 750 m/s. Suppression of the EIA is observed during the storm recovery phase on 25 August, which probably is associated with the westward disturbance dynamo electric field and the equatorward expansion of the neutral composition changes (O/N-2 depletion).

AB A controversy has risen in the direction of ionospheric electric field perturbation on the dayside caused by substorm expansion phase in recent years, i.e., eastward or westward. To exclude the effect of interplanetary magnetic field northward turning, the substorms without interplanetary field (IMF) trigger are required to investigate this issue. Previous works, such as that by Huang et al. (2004), showed that the eastward electric field perturbations caused by substorms can be observed. However, our case suggests that some substorms can produce strong westward electric field perturbations and drive westward equatorial electrojets on the dayside ionosphere. This westward electric field is created by an overshielding-like imbalance state of field-aligned currents (FACs), Region 2 (R2) FAC greater than Region 1 (R1) FAC, which is built up through R2 FAC enhancement rather than R1 FAC reduction due to IMF northward turning. The substorm processes should be responsible for the westward electric field especially through polar cap shrinkage and magnetic field dipolarization.

AB A basic constraint to be satisfied by a Brans class I solution for being a traversible wormhole is derived. It is argued that the solution could be a wormhole analog of the Horowitz-Ross naked black hole. It is further demonstrated that the wormhole is traversible only 'in principle', but not in practice. Using a recently proposed measure of total gravitational energy inside a static wormhole configuration, it is shown that the wormhole contains the repulsive gravity required for the defocussing of orbits at the throat.

ID EQUATORIAL SPREAD-F; MIDLATITUDE IONOSPHERE; GENERATION
AB In this paper we present the first results of F region field-aligned irregularities (FAI) made during the summer of low solar condition using the Gadanki mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere radar. FAI echoes were observed on all 20 nights of radar observations and were mostly confined to the postmidnight hours. Echo morphology is found to be very different from the equinoctial postsunset features reported earlier from Gadanki. Echo SNRs are lower by 25 dB than their equinoctial postsunset counterparts but are quite comparable to those of the equinoctial decaying FAI during the postmidnight hours. The Doppler velocities, which lie in the range of +/-100 m s(-1), are predominantly upward-northward during 0000-0300 LT and downward-southward afterward, in contrast to those observed as predominantly downward-southward associated with the decaying equinoctial postmidnight F region FAI. Spectral widths of the summer echoes, which are well below 50 m s(-1) and are very similar to those of the decaying equinoctial irregularities, represent the presence of weak plasma turbulence. Simultaneous observations made using a collocated ionosonde show no ionogram trace during 2200-0530 LT except for a few cases of weak spread F events. Concurrent ionosonde observations made from magnetic equatorial location Trivandrum also show very similar results. The observations are discussed in the light of current understanding on the postmidnight occurrence of F region irregularities in the summer of low solar condition.

AB Using imaging that shows 4 mag of main-sequence stars, we have discovered that the Galactic globular cluster NGC 1851 is surrounded by a halo that is visible from the tidal radius of 700 arcsec (41 pc) to more than 4500 arcsec (> 250 pc). This halo is symmetric and falls in density as a power law of r(-1.24). It contains approximately 0.1% of the dynamical mass of NGC 1851. There is no evidence for tidal tails. Current models of globular cluster evolution do not explain this feature, although simulations of tidal influences on dwarf spheroidal galaxies qualitatively mimic these results. Given the state of published models, it is not possible to decide between creation of this halo from either isolated cluster evaporation or from tidal or disk shocking, or from destruction of a dwarf galaxy in which this object may have once been embedded.

AB We present the results of a survey of damped (DLA, log N(H I) > 20.3) and sub-damped Lyman-alpha systems (19.5 < log N(H I) < 20.3) at z > 2.55 along the lines-of-sight to 77 quasars with emission redshifts in the range 4 < z(em) < 6.3. Intermediate resolution (R similar to 4300) spectra were obtained with the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) mounted on the Keck telescope. A total of 100 systems with log N(H I) > 19.5 were detected of which 40 systems are damped Lyman-alpha systems for an absorption length of Delta X = 378. About half of the lines of sight of this homogeneous survey have never been investigated for DLAs. We study the evolution with redshift of the cosmological density of the neutral gas and find, consistent with previous studies at similar resolution, that Omega(DLA,HI) decreases at z > 3.5. The overall cosmological evolution of Omega(HI) shows a peak around this redshift. The H I column density distribution for log N(H I) >= 20.3 is fitted, consistent with previous surveys, with a single power-law of index alpha similar to -1.8 +/- 0.25. This power-law overpredicts data at the high-end and a second, much steeper, power-law (or a gamma function) is needed. There is a flattening of the function at lower H i column densities with an index of alpha similar to -1.4 for the column density range log N(H I) = 19.5-21. The fraction of H I mass in sub-DLAs is of the order of 30%. The H I column density distribution does not evolve strongly from z similar to 2.5 to z similar to 4.5.

AB Aims. We investigate wave propagation and energy transport in magnetic elements, which are representatives of small scale magnetic flux concentrations in the magnetic network on the Sun. This is a continuation of earlier work by Hasan et al. (2005, ApJ, 631, 1270). The new features in the present investigation include a quantitative evaluation of the energy transport in the various modes and for different field strengths, as well as the effect of the boundary-layer thickness on wave propagation.
   Methods. We carry out 2D MHD numerical simulations of magnetic flux concentrations for strong and moderate magnetic fields for which beta (the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure) on the tube axis at the photospheric base is 0.4 and 1.7, respectively. Waves are excited in the tube and ambient medium by a transverse impulsive motion of the lower boundary.
   Results. The nature of the modes excited depends on the value of beta. Mode conversion occurs in the moderate field case when the fast mode crosses the beta = 1 contour. In the strong field case the fast mode undergoes conversion from predominantly magnetic to predominantly acoustic when waves are leaking from the interior of the flux concentration to the ambient medium. We also estimate the energy fluxes in the acoustic and magnetic modes and find that in the strong field case, the vertically directed acoustic wave fluxes reach spatially averaged, temporal maximum values of a few times 10(6) crg cm(-2) s(-1) at chromospheric height levels.
   Conclusions. The main conclusions of our work are twofold: firstly, for transverse, impulsive excitation, flux tubes/sheets with strong fields are more efficient than those with weak fields in providing acoustic flux to the chromosphere. However, there is insufficient energy in the acoustic flux to balance the chromospheric radiative losses in the network, even for the strong field case. Secondly, the acoustic emission from the interface between the flux concentration and the ambient medium decreases with the width of the boundary layer.

AB Aims. The detection of rotational transitions of the AlO radical at millimeter wavelengths from an astronomical source has recently been reported. In view of this, rotational transitions in the ground X-2 Sigma(+) state of AlO have been reinvestigated.
   Methods. Comparisons between Fourier transform and microwave data indicate a discrepancy regarding the derived value of gamma(D) in the v = 0 level of the ground state. This discrepancy is discussed in the light of comparisons between experimental data and synthesized rotational spectra in the v = 0, 1 and 2 levels of X-2 Sigma(+).
   Results. A list of calculated rotational lines in v = 0, 1 and 2 of the ground state up to N' = 11 is presented which should aid astronomers in analysis and interpretation of observed AlO data and also facilitate future searches for this radical.

AB Aims. Recent studies have detected linear polarization in L dwarfs in the optical I band. Theoretical models have been developed to explain this polarization. These models predict higher polarization at shorter wavelengths. We discuss the polarization in the R and I band of 4 ultra cool dwarfs.
   Methods. We report linear polarization measurements of 4 ultra cool dwarfs in the R and I bands using the Intermediate dispersion Spectrograph and Imaging System ( ISIS) mounted on the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope (WHT).
   Results. As predicted by theoretical models, we find a higher degree of polarization in the R band when compared to polarization in the I band for 3/4 of these ultra cool dwarfs. This suggests that dust scattering asymmetry is caused by oblateness. We also show how these measurements fit the theoretical models. A case for variability of linear polarization is found, which suggests the presence of randomly distributed dust clouds. We also discuss one case for the presence of a cold debris disk.

AB Context. We investigate the young ( proto) stellar population in NGC 2023 and the L 1630 molecular cloud bordering the H II region IC 434, using Spitzer IRAC and MIPS archive data, JCMT SCUBA imaging and spectroscopy as well as targeted BIMA observations of one of the Class 0 protostars, NGC 2023 MM 1.
   Aims. We study the distribution of gas, dust and young stars in this region to see where stars are forming, whether the expansion of the h II region has triggered star formation, and whether dense cold cores have already formed stars.
   Methods. We have performed photometry of all IRAC and MIPS images, and used color-color diagrams to identify and classify all young stars seen within a 22' x 26' field along the boundary between IC 434 and L 1630. For some stars, which have sufficient optical, IR, and/or sub-millimeter data we have also used the online SED fitting tool for a large 2D archive of axisymmetric radiative transfer models to perform more detailed modeling of the observed SEDs. We identify 5 sub-millimeter cores in our 850 and 450 mu m SCUBA images, two of which have embedded class 0 or I protostars. Observations with BIMA are used to refine the position and characteristics of the Class 0 source NGC 2023 MM 1. These observations show that it is embedded in a very cold cloud core, which is strongly enhanced in NH(2)D.
   Results. We find that HD37903 is the most massive member of a cluster with 20-30 PMS stars. We also find smaller groups of PMS stars formed from the Horsehead nebula and another elephant trunk structure to the north of the Horsehead. Star formation is also occurring in the dark lane seen in IRAC images and in the sub-millimeter continuum. We refine the spectral classification of HD37903 to B2 Ve. We find that the star has a clear IR excess, and therefore it is a young Herbig Be star.
   Conclusions. Our study shows that the expansion of the IC 434 H II region has triggered star formation in some of the dense elephant trunk structures and compressed gas inside the L 1630 molecular cloud. This pre-shock region is seen as a sub-millimeter ridge in which stars have already formed. The cluster associated with NGC 2023 is very young, and has a large fraction of Class I sources.

   FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; PULSATING STARS
AB Context. Ongoing and future surveys of variable stars will require new techniques to analyse their light curves as well as to tag objects according to their variability class in an automated way.
   Aims. We show the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition (FD) method as tools for variable star light curve analysis and compare their relative performance in studying the changes in the light curve structures of pulsating Cepheids and in the classification of variable stars.
   Methods. We have calculated the Fourier parameters of 17 606 light curves of a variety of variables, e. g., RR Lyraes, Cepheids, Mira Variables and extrinsic variables for our analysis. We have also performed PCA on the same database of light curves. The inputs to the PCA are the 100 values of the magnitudes for each of these 17 606 light curves in the database interpolated between phase 0 to 1. Unlike some previous studies, Fourier coefficients are not used as input to the PCA.
   Results. We show that in general, the first few principal components (PCs) are enough to reconstruct the original light curves compared to the FD method where 2 to 3 times more parameters are required to satisfactorily reconstruct the light curves. The computation of the required number of Fourier parameters on average needs 20 times more CPU time than the computation of the required number of PCs. Therefore, PCA does have some advantages over the FD method in analysing the variable stars in a larger database. However, in some cases, particularly in finding the resonances in fundamental mode (FU) Cepheids, the PCA results show no distinct advantages over the FD method. We also demonstrate that the PCA technique can be used to classify variables into different variability classes in an automated, unsupervised way, a feature that has immense potential for larger databases in the future.

   Aims. The aim of the survey is to search for such chemically peculiar stars that are pulsationally unstable.
   Methods. The observations of the sample stars were carried out in high-speed photometric mode using a three-channel fast photometer attached to the 1.04-m Sampurnanand telescope at ARIES.
   Results. The new photometric observations confirmed that the pulsational period of star HD25515 is 2.78-hrs. The repeated time-series observations of HD 113878 and HD 118660 revealed that previously known frequencies are indeed present in the new data sets. We have estimated the distances, absolute magnitudes, effective temperatures and luminosities of these stars. Their positions in the H-R diagram indicate that HD 25515 and HD 118660 lie near the main-sequence while HD 113878 is an evolved star. We also present a catalogue of 61 stars classified as null results, along with the corresponding 87 frequency spectra taken from 2002-2008. A statistical analysis of these null results shows, by comparison with past data, that the power of the noise in the light curves has slightly increased during the last few years.

TI MAGNETIC RECONNECTION DURING THE TWO-PHASE EVOLUTION OF A SOLAR ERUPTIVE

AB We present a detailed multi-wavelength analysis and interpretation of the evolution of an M7.6 flare that occurred near the southeast limb on 2003 October 24. Pre-flare images at TRACE 195 angstrom show that the bright and complex system of coronal loops already existed at the flaring site. The X-ray observations of the flare taken from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) spacecraft reveal two phases of the flare evolution. The first phase is characterized by the altitude decrease of the X-ray looptop (LT) source for similar to 11 minutes. Such a long duration of the descending LT source motion is reported for the first time. The EUV loops, located below the X-ray LT source, also undergo contraction with similar speed (similar to 15 km s(-1)) in this interval. During the second phase the two distinct hard X-ray footpoint (FP) sources are observed which correlate well with UV and Ha flare ribbons. The X-ray LT source now exhibits upward motion as anticipated from the standard flare model. The RHESSI spectra during the first phase are soft and indicative of hot thermal emission from flaring loops with temperatures T > 25 MK at the early stage. On the other hand, the spectra at high energies (epsilon greater than or similar to 25 keV) follow hard power laws during the second phase (gamma = 2.6-2.8). We show that the observed motion of the LT and FP sources can be understood as a consequence of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection at a separator in the corona. During the first phase of the flare, the reconnection releases an excess of magnetic energy related to the magnetic tensions generated before a flare by the shear flows in the photosphere. The relaxation of the associated magnetic shear in the corona by the reconnection process explains the descending motion of the LT source. During the second phase, the ordinary reconnection process dominates describing the energy release in terms of the standard model of large eruptive flares with increasing FP separation and upward motion of the LT source.

AB The X-3.4 class flare of 2006 December 13 was observed with a high cadence of 2 minutes at 0.2 arcsec resolution by HINODE/SOT FG instrument. The flare ribbons could be seen in G-band images also. A careful analysis of these observations after proper registration of images shows flare-related changes in penumbral filaments of the associated sunspot for the first time. The observations of sunspot deformation, decay of penumbral area, and changes in magnetic flux during large flares have been reported earlier in the literature. In this Letter, we report lateral motion of the penumbral filaments in a sheared region of the d-sunspot during the X-class flare. Such shifts have not been seen earlier. The lateral motion occurs in two phases: (1) motion before the flare ribbons move across the penumbral filaments and (2) motion afterward. The former motion is directed away from expanding flare ribbons and lasts for about 4 minutes. The latter motion is directed in the opposite direction and lasts for more than 40 minutes. Further, we locate a patch in adjacent opposite polarity spot moving in opposite direction to the penumbral filaments. Together these patches represent conjugate footpoints on either side of the polarity inversion line, moving toward each other. This converging motion could be interpreted as shrinkage of field lines.

AB It is expected that energetic solar flares releasing a large amount of energy at the photosphere may be able to excite the acoustic (p-) modes of oscillations. We have determined the characteristic properties of mode parameters by applying the ring diagram technique to three-dimensional power spectra obtained for solar active region NOAA 10486 during the long-duration energetic X17.2/4B flare of 2003 October 28. Strong evidence of substantial increase in mode amplitude and systematic variations in sub-surface flows, i.e., meridional and zonal components of velocity, kinetic helicity, and vorticity, is found from comparison of the pre- to the post-flare phases.

AB We present the results of simulations of shadows cast by a zone plate telescope which may have one to four pairs of zone plates. From the shadows we reconstruct the images under various circumstances. We discuss physical basis of the resolution of the telescope and demonstrate this by our simulations. We allow the source to be at a finite distance (diverging beam) as well as at an infinite distance (parallel beam) and show that the resolution is worsened when the source is nearby. By reconstructing the zone plates in a way that both the zone plates subtend the same solid angles at the source, we obtain back high resolution even for sources at a finite distance. We present simulated results for the observation of the galactic center and show that the sources of varying intensities may be reconstructed with accuracy. Results of these simulations would be of immense use in interpreting the X-ray images from recently launched CORONAS-PHOTON satellite.

For the vacuum stationary axially symmetric spacetimes, we use the Geroch formalism to express the Einstein equations in terms of inertial forces. For the spacetimes with the perfect fluid sources, we use the formalism developed by Hansen and Winicour for establishing the relations. As expected intuitively, the gradients of inertial forces represent the field equations.

This spacetime is an example of a black hole in an asymptotically non-flat background. We construct the Carter constant and obtain the Killing tensor in the VEK spacetime. The Newman-Penrose formalism is employed to obtain the spin coefficients. We present a complete (Petrov) classification of the VEK spacetime and the special case of the non-rotating Vaidya-Einstein-Schwarzschild spacetime. We demonstrate explicitly that both spacetimes are of type-D.

AB The rapid neutron capture process (r-process) is one of the major nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the synthesis of heavy nuclei beyond iron. Isotopes beyond Fe are most exclusively formed in neutron capture processes and more heavier ones are produced by the r-process. Approximately half of the heavy elements with mass number A > 70 and all of the actinides in the solar system are believed to have been produced in the r-process. We have studied the r-process in supernovae for the production of heavy elements beyond A = 40 with the newest mass values available. The supernova envelopes at a temperature > 109 K and neutron density of 10(24) cm(-3) are considered to be one of the most potential sites for the r-process. The primary goal of the r-process calculations is to fit the global abundance curve for solar system r-process isotopes by varying time dependent parameters such as temperature and neutron density. This method aims at comparing the calculated abundances of the stable isotopes with observation. We have studied the r-process path corresponding to temperatures ranging from 1.0 x 10(9) K to 3.0 x 10(9) K and neutron density ranging from 10(20) cm(-3) to 10(30) cm(-3). With temperature and density conditions of 3.0 x 10(9) K and 10(20) cm(-3) a nucleus of mass 273 was theoretically found corresponding to atomic number 115. The elements obtained along the r-process path are compared with the observed data at all the above temperature and density range.

AB We have investigated the out of plane equilibrium points of a passive micron size particle and their stability in the field of radiating binary stellar systems Kruger-60, RW-Monocerotis within the framework of photo-gravitational circular restricted three-body problem. We find that the out of plane equilibrium points (L (i) , i = 6, 7, 8, 9) may exist for range of beta (1) (ratio of radiation to gravitational force of the massive component) values for these binary systems in the presence of Poynting-Robertson drag (hereafter PR-drag). In the absence of PR-drag, we find that the motion of a particle near the equilibrium points L (6,7) is stable in both the binary systems for a specific range of beta (1) values. The PR-drag is shown to cause instability of the various out of plane equilibrium points in these binary systems.

AB Since 2004, we have been engaged in a long-term observing programme to monitor young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We have collected about 2000 frames in V, R and I broad-band filters on more than 200 nights distributed over five consecutive observing seasons. The high-quality and time-extended photometric data give us an opportunity to address various phenomena associated with young stars. The prime motivations of this project are (i) to explore various manifestations of stellar magnetic activity in very young low-mass stars, (ii) to search for new pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries and (iii) to look for any EXor and FUor-like transient activities associated with YSOs. Since this is the first paper on this programme, we give a detailed description of the science drivers, the observation and the data reduction strategies as well. In addition to these, we also present a large number of new periodic variables detected from our first 5 yr of time-series photometric data. Our study reveals that about 72 per cent of classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) in our field of view are periodic, whereas only 32 per cent of weak-lined T Tauri stars (WTTS) are periodic. This indicates that inhomogeneity patterns on the surface of CTTS of the ONC stars are much more stable than on WTTS. From our multiyear monitoring campaign, we found that the photometric surveys based on single season are incapable of identifying all periodic variables. And any study on evolution of angular momentum based on single-season surveys must be carried out with caution.

AB The angular-momentum flux from an inspiralling binary system of compact objects moving in quasi-elliptical orbits is computed at the third post-Newtonian (3PN) order using the multipolar post-Minkowskian wave generation formalism. The 3PN angular-momentum flux involves the instantaneous, tail, and tail-of-tails contributions as for the 3PN energy flux, and in addition a contribution due to nonlinear memory. We average the angular-momentum flux over the binary's orbit using the 3PN quasi-Keplerian representation of elliptical orbits. The averaged angular-momentum flux provides the final input needed for gravitational-wave phasing of binaries moving in quasi-elliptical orbits. We obtain the evolution of orbital elements under 3PN gravitational radiation reaction in the quasi-elliptic case. For small eccentricities, we give simpler limiting expressions relevant for phasing up to order e(2). This work is important for the construction of templates for quasi-eccentric binaries, and for the comparison of post-Newtonian results with the numerical relativity simulations of the plunge and merger of eccentric binaries.

DT Article
ID ADS/CFT CORRESPONDENCE; RENORMALIZATION; ENERGY; TENSOR; LIMIT
AB We consider a deformation of the AdS(5)xS(5) solution of IIB supergravity obtained by taking the boundary value of the dilaton to be time dependent. The time dependence is taken to be slowly varying on the anti-de Sitter (AdS) scale thereby introducing a small parameter epsilon. The boundary dilaton has a profile which asymptotes to a constant in the far past and future and attains a minimum value at intermediate times. We construct the supergravity (sugra) solution to first nontrivial order in epsilon, and find that it is smooth, horizon-free, and asymptotically AdS(5)xS(5) in the far future. When the intermediate values of the dilaton becomes small enough the curvature becomes of order the string scale and the sugra approximation breaks down. The resulting dynamics is analyzed in the dual SU(N) gauge theory on S(3) with a time dependent coupling constant which varies slowly. When N epsilon < 1, we find that a quantum adiabatic approximation is applicable, and use it to argue that at late times the geometry becomes smooth AdS(5)xS(5) again. When N epsilon 1, we formulate a classical adiabatic perturbation theory based on coherent states which arises in the large N limit. For large values of the 't Hooft coupling this reproduces the supergravity results. For small 't Hooft coupling the coherent state calculations become involved and we cannot reach a definite conclusion. We argue that the final state should have a dual description which is mostly smooth AdS(5) space with the possible presence of a small black hole.

ID BLACK-HOLE EVAPORATION; GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE; BACK-REACTION; RADIATION
AB We explore in detail the semiclassical environment of collapsing shells of matter, and determine the semiclassical flux measured by a variety of observers. This study is a preliminary step in a broader investigation of thermodynamic properties of the geometry of collapsing objects. Specifically, in this paper we consider spherically symmetric null and timelike collapsing shells which form an event horizon, and calculate the flux measured by observers both inside and outside the shell, and both inside and outside the event horizon, and find nontrivial results in most of the cases. Additionally, we also investigate the environment of a shell which collapses but does not form a horizon, halting at some radius larger than the Schwarzschild radius, and find that such an object generically gives rise to a pulse of radiation which is sharply peaked as it travels inwards and is reflected at the origin, and eventually emerges from the shell in a thermalized form. Our results have potential consequences in addressing questions pertaining, e.g. to black hole entropy and backreaction.

TI Flavor composition of ultrahigh energy neutrinos at source and at

DT Article
ID ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI
AB We parametrize the initial flux composition of high energy astrophysical neutrinos as (Phi(0)(e):Phi(0)(mu):Phi(0)(tau))=(1:n:0), where n characterizes the source. All usually assumed neutrino sources appear as limits of this simple parametrization. We investigate how precise neutrino telescopes can pin down the value of n. We furthermore show that there is a neutrino mixing scenario in which the ratio of muon neutrinos to the other neutrinos takes a constant value regardless of the initial flux composition. This occurs when the muon neutrino survival probability takes its minimal allowed value. The phenomenological consequences of this very predictive neutrino mixing scenario are given.

AB A particular framework for quantum gravity is the doubly special relativity (DSR) formalism that introduces a new observer independent scale, the Planck energy. Our aim in this paper is to study the effects of this energy upper bound in relativistic thermodynamics. We have explicitly computed the modified equation of state for an ideal fluid in the DSR framework. In deriving our result we exploited the scheme of treating DSR as a nonlinear representation of the Lorentz group in special relativity.

AB Recently it has been advocated [A. G. Cohen and S. L. Glashow, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 021601 (2006)] that for describing nature within the minimal symmetry requirement, certain subgroups of the Lorentz group may play a fundamental role. One such group is E(2) which induces a Lie algebraic noncommutative spacetime [M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari and A. Tureanu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 261601 (2008); arXiv:0811.3670] where translation invariance is not fully maintained. We have constructed a consistent structure of noncommutative phase space for this system, and furthermore we have studied an appropriate point particle action on it. Interestingly, the Einstein dispersion relation p(2)=m(2) remains intact. The model is constructed by exploiting a dual canonical phase space following the scheme developed by us earlier [S. Ghosh and P. Pal, Phys. Rev. D 75, 105021 (2007)].

TI Detecting gravitational waves from inspiraling binaries with a network
   of geographically separated detectors: Coherent versus coincident
   strategies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID COALESCING BINARIES; COMPACT BINARIES; PARAMETERS; SIGNALS
AB We compare two strategies of multidetector detection of compact binary inspiral signals, namely, the coincidence and the coherent for the realistic case of geographically separated detectors. The naive coincident strategy treats the detectors as if they are isolated-compares individual detector statistics with their respective thresholds while the coherent strategy combines the detector network data coherently to obtain a single detection statistic which is then compared with a single threshold. We also consider an enhanced coincidence strategy which is intermediate in the sense that though the individual statistics are added in quadrature and the sum compared with a single threshold, the estimated parameters are also checked for consistency. For simplicity, we consider detector pairs having the same power spectral density of noise, as that of initial LIGO and also assume the noise to be stationary and Gaussian. Further, since we consider the detectors to be widely separated on Earth, we take the instrumental noises to be uncorrelated; the wide separation implicitly means that since the detector arms must lie parallel to the Earth's surface, the detectors necessarily have different orientations. We compare the performances of the methods by plotting the receiver operating characteristics for the strategies. Several results are derived analytically in order to gain insight. Simulations are performed in order to plot the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A single astrophysical source as well as a distribution of sources is considered. We assume a 1 yr data train and a mass range of 1-40M(circle dot) for the case of astrophysically distributed sources. We find that the coherent strategy is superior to the two coincident strategies that we consider. Remarkably, the detection probability of the coherent strategy is 50% better than the naive coincident strategy. One the other hand, the difference in performance between the coherent strategy and enhanced coincident strategy is not very large. Even in this situation, it is not difficult to perform the real data analysis with the coherent strategy. The bottom line is that the coherent strategy is a good detection strategy.

AB We investigate the shear viscosity of neutron star matter in the presence of an antikaon condensate. The electron and muon number densities are reduced due to the appearance of a K- condensate in neutron star matter, whereas the proton number density increases. Consequently, the shear viscosity due to scatterings of electrons and muons with themselves and protons is lowered compared to the case without the condensate. On the other hand, the contribution of proton-proton collisions to the proton shear viscosity through electromagnetic and strong interactions becomes important and comparable to the neutron shear viscosity.

AB We consider stability of spherically symmetric solutions in f(R) gravity model proposed by Starobinsky. We find that the model suffers from a severe fine-tuning problem when applied to compact objects like neutron stars. The problem can be remedied by introducing a cutoff on the mass of the scalar degree of freedom present in the model. A new mass scale associated with neutron stars density is then required for the stabilities of f(R) gravity solutions inside relativistic stars.

AB A single stone weighing about 1.6 kg fell in Kaprada village of south Gujarat, India in October, 2004. It has been studied for mineralogy, petrography, chemical and isotopic composition and cosmogenic effects. The olivine is 23.7% fayalite. The petrography, bulk chemistry and oxygen isotopic composition indicate that it belongs to L(5/6) group of chondrites. The cosmic ray exposure age of the meteorite is estimated to be 11.4 Ma based on He, Ne and At isotopes. A trapped nitrogen amount of 0.25 ppm with delta(15)N=4.7 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand is typical of ordinary chondrites of higher metamorphic grade. The gas retention ages, based on U/Th-(4)He and K-(40)Ar are calculated to be 2.6 and 4.1 Ga, respectively. Cosmic ray track data indicate that the pre-atmospheric radius of the meteorite was about 7 cm, and about 75% mass was ablated during its journey through the Earth's atmosphere.

Measurements by the Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA) instrument on the Indian Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft in orbit around the Moon show that up to 20% of the impinging solar wind protons are reflected from the lunar surface back to space as neutral hydrogen atoms. This finding, generally applicable to regolith-covered atmosphereless bodies, invalidates the widely accepted assumption that regolith almost completely absorbs the impinging solar wind.

AB We present the orbital X-ray modulation study of three high mass X-ray binary systems, IGR J18027-2016, IGR J18483-0311 and IGR J16318-4848, using data obtained with RXTE-ASM, Swift-BAT and INTEGRAL-ISGRI. Using the long term light curves of the eclipsing HMXB IGR J18027-2016, obtained with Swift-BAT in the energy range 15-50 keV and INTEGRAL-ISGRI in the energy range 22-40 keV, we have determined three new mid eclipse times. The newly determined mid eclipse times together with the known values were used to derive an accurate value of the orbital period of 4.5693(4) d at MJD 52168 and an upper limit of 3.9(1.2) x 10(-7) d d(-1) on the period derivative. We have also accurately determined an orbital period of 18.5482(88)d for the intermediate system IGR J18483-0311, which displays an unusual behavior and shares many properties with the known SFXTs and persistent supergiant systems. This is a transient source and the outbursts occur intermittently at intervals of 18.55 d. Similarly, in the third supergiant system, IGR J16318-4848, we have found that the outbursts are separated by intervals of 80 d or its multiples, suggesting a possible orbital period.

AB We investigate the transition of a radiatively inefficient phase of a viscous two temperature accreting flow to a cooling dominated phase and vice versa around black holes. Based on a global sub-Keplerian accretion disk model in steady state, including explicit cooling processes self-consistently, we show that general advective accretion flow passes through various phases during its infall towards a black hole. Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and inverse Comptonization of soft photons are considered as possible cooling mechanisms. Hence the flow governs a much lower electron temperature similar to 10(8) - 10(9.5) K compared to the hot protons of temperature similar to 10(10.2) - 10(11.8) K in the range of the accretion rate in Eddington units 0.01 less than or similar to (M) over dot less than or similar to 100. Therefore, the solutions may potentially explain the hard X-rays and the gamma-rays emitted from AGNs and X-ray binaries. We finally compare the solutions for two different regimes of viscosity and conclude that a weakly viscous flow is expected to be cooling dominated compared to its highly viscous counterpart which is radiatively inefficient. The flow is successfully able to reproduce the observed luminosities of the under-fed AGNs and quasars (e.g. Sgr A*), ultra-luminous X-ray sources (e.g. SS433), as well as the highly luminous AGNs and ultra-luminous quasars (e.g. PKS 0743-67) at different combinations of the mass accretion rate and ratio of specific heats.

We use the rescaled range (R/S) analysis to estimate the Hurst exponent for 259-year and 11 360-year sunspot data. The results show a varying degree of persistence over shorter and longer time scales corresponding to distinct values of the Hurst exponent. We explain the presence of these multiple Hurst exponents by their resemblance to the deterministic chaotic attractors having multiple centers of rotation.

AB In this article we present the results of a study of the spatial distribution and asymmetry of solar active prominences (SAP) for the period 1996 through 2007 (solar cycle 23). For more meaningful statistical analysis we analyzed the distribution and asymmetry of SAP in two subdivisions viz. Group1 (ADF, APR, DSF, CRN, CAP) and Group2 (AFS, ASR, BSD, BSL, DSD, SPY, LPS). The North -aEuro parts per thousand South (N -aEuro parts per thousand S) latitudinal distribution shows that the SAP events are most prolific in the 21A degrees to 30A degrees slice in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres; the East -aEuro parts per thousand West (E -aEuro parts per thousand W) longitudinal distribution study shows that the SAP events are most prolific (best observable) in the 81A degrees to 90A degrees slice in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. It was found that the SAP activity during this cycle is low compared to previous solar cycles. The present study indicates that during the rising phase of the cycle the number of SAP events are roughly equal in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. However, activity in the Southern Hemisphere has been dominant since 1999. Our statistical study shows that the N -aEuro parts per thousand S asymmetry is more significant then the E -aEuro parts per thousand W asymmetry.

   SAMPLE; SPECTRUM; EVOLUTION
AB We summarize the attempts by our group and others to derive constraints on variations of fundamental constants over cosmic time using quasar absorption lines. Most upper limits reside in the range 0.5-1.5x10(-5) at the 3 sigma level over a redshift range of approximately 0.5-2.5 for the fine-structure constant, alpha, the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu and a combination of the proton gyromagnetic factor and the two previous constants, g (p)(alpha (2)/mu) (nu) , for only one claimed variation of alpha. It is therefore very important to perform new measurements to improve the sensitivity of the numerous methods to at least < 0.1x10(-5) which should be possible in the next few years. Future instrumentations on ELTs in the optical and/or ALMA, EVLA and SKA pathfinders in the radio will undoutedly boost this field by allowing to reach much better signal-to-noise ratios at higher spectral resolution and to perform measurements on molecules in the ISM of high redshift galaxies.

AB The Romans type IIA theory is the only known example of 10-dimensional maximal supergravity where (tensor) fields are explicitly massive. We provide an example of a non-relativistic anti-de-Sitter NRadS(4) X S-6 background as a solution in massive type IIA. A compactification of which on S-6 gives immediately the prototype NRadS background in D = 4 which is proposed to be dual to 'cold atoms' or unitary fermions on a wire. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Within a relativistic mean-field model with nonlinear isoscalar-isovector Coupling, we explore the possibility of constraining the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy from a systematic study of the neutron skin thickness of finite nuclei and neutron star properties. We find the present skin data supports a rather stiff symmetry energy at subsaturation densities that corresponds to a soft symmetry energy at supranormal densities. Correlation between the skin of Pb-208 and the neutron star masses and radii with kaon condensation has been studied. We find that Pb-208 skin estimate Suggest star radii that reveals considerable model dependence. Thus precise measurements of neutron star radii in conjunction with skin thickness of heavy nuclei could provide significant constraint on the density dependence of symmetry energy.

AB We present multifrequency radio observations with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and Very Large Array, and X-ray observations with the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton) telescope of the giant radio source (GRS) 3C 457. We have detected the core, lobes and the environment of the GRS in X-ray. We examine the relationships between the radio and X-ray emission, determine the radio spectrum over a large frequency range and attribute the X-ray emission from the lobes to the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons. The magnetic field strength of the lobes is very close to the equipartition value. Both the lobes are in pressure balance near the hotspots and apparently underpressured towards the core. The X-ray spectrum of the core of the GRS consists of an unabsorbed soft power-law component and a heavily absorbed hard power-law component. The soft unabsorbed component is likely to be related to the radio jets. There is no strong evidence of Fe K alpha emission line in our data.

AB In the present work, we perform time-series analysis on the latitude bins of the solar full disc (SFD) images of Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) at 17 GHz. The flux modulation method traces the passage of radio features over the solar disc and the autocorrelation analysis of the time-series data of SFD images (one per day) for the period 1999-2001 gives the rotation period as a function of latitude extending from 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N. The results show that the solar corona rotates less differentially than the photosphere and chromosphere, i.e. it has smaller gradient in the rotation rate.

AB We report long-slit spectroscopic observations of SDSS J092712+294344 carried out at the recently commissioned 2-m telescope in IUCAA Girawali Observatory, India. This active galactic nuclei like source is known to feature three sets of emission lines at z(em) = 0.6972, 0.7020 and 0.7128. Different scenarios such as a recoiling black hole after asymmetric emission of gravitational waves, binary black holes and possible merging systems are proposed for this object. We test these scenarios by comparing our spectra with that from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, obtained 4 years prior to our observations. Comparing the redshifts of [OIII]lambda lambda 4960,5008, we put a 3 sigma limit on the relative acceleration to be less than 32 km s(-1) yr(-1) between different emitting regions. Using the two-dimensional spectra obtained at different position angles (PAs), we show that the [OIII]lambda 5008 line from the z(em) = 0.7128 component is extended beyond the spectral point spread function. We infer the linear extent of this line emitting region is similar to 8 kpc. We also find a tentative evidence for an offset between the centroid of the [OIII]lambda 5008 line at z(em) = 0.7128 and the quasi-stellar object trace when the slit is aligned at a PA of 299 degrees. This corresponds to the z(em) = 0.7128 system being at an impact parameter of similar to 1 kpc with respect to the z(em) = 0.6972 in the north-west direction. Based on our observations, we conclude that the binary black hole model is most unlikely. The spatial extent and the sizes are consistent with both black hole recoil and merging scenarios.

Strominger, arXiv:0809.4266 [hep-th]] to 5-dimensional Anti-de Sitter gravity theories with neutral scalars non-minimally coupled to gauge fields. Due to the attractor mechanism. the near horizon geometry of extremal black holes is universal and is determined by only the charge parameters. In particular, we study a class of near horizon geometries that contain an AdS(2) x S-2 factor after Kaluza-Klein reduction. In this way we obtain the microscopic entropy of Gutowski-Reall black hole. We also point out a possible connection with the AdS(2)/CFT1 correspondence. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate the young stellar population in and near the cometary globule Ori I-2. The analysis is based on deep Nordic Optical Telescope R-band and H alpha images, JCMT SCUBA 450 and 850 mu m images combined with near-infrared Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) photometry and mid-infrared archival Spitzer images obtained with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC; 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 mu m), and MIPS (24 and 70 mu m) instruments. We identify a total of 125 sources within the 5' x 5' region imaged by the IRAC. Of these sources, 87 are detected in the R-band image and 51 are detected in the 2MASS. The detailed physical properties of the sources are explored using a combination of near/mid-infrared color-color diagrams, graybody fitting of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and an online SED fitting tool that uses a library of two-dimensional radiation transfer based accretion models of young stellar objects with disks. Ori I-2 shows clear evidence of triggered star formation with four young low-luminosity pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars embedded in the globule. At least two, possibly as many as four, additional low-mass PMS objects were discovered in the field which are probably part of the young sigma Orionis cluster. Among the PMS stars which have formed in the globule, MIR-54 is a young, deeply embedded Class 0/I object; MIR-51 and 52 are young Class II sources, while MIR-89 is a more evolved, heavily extincted Class II object with its apparent colors mimicking a Class 0/I object. The Class 0/I object MIR-54 coincides with a previously known IRAS source and is a strong submillimeter source. It is most likely the source for the molecular outflow and the large parsec-scale Herbig-Haro (HH) flow. However, the nearby Class II source, MIR-52, which is strong a H alpha emission line star, also appears to drive an outflow approximately aligned with the outflow from MIR-54, and because of the proximity of the two outflows, either star could contribute. MIR-89 appears to excite a low-excitation HH object, HH 992, discovered for the first time in this study.

AB Various theoretical and observational results have been reported regarding the presence/absence of net electric currents in the sunspots. The limited spatial resolution of the earlier observations perhaps obscured the conclusions. We have analyzed 12 sunspots observed from Hinode ( Solar Optical Telescope/Spectro-polarimeter) to clarify the issue. The azimuthal and radial components of magnetic fields and currents have been derived. The azimuthal component of the magnetic field of sunspots is found to vary in sign with azimuth. The radial component of the field also varies in magnitude with azimuth. While the latter pattern is a confirmation of the interlocking combed structure of penumbral filaments, the former pattern shows that the penumbra is made up of a "curly interlocking combed" magnetic field. The azimuthally averaged azimuthal component is seen to decline much faster than 1/(omega) over bar in the penumbra, after an initial increase in the umbra, for all the spots studied. This confirms the confinement of magnetic fields and absence of a net current for sunspots as postulated by Parker. The existence of a global twist for a sunspot even in the absence of a net current is consistent with a fibril-bundle structure of the sunspot magnetic fields.

AB A Monte Carlo model has been developed to study the degradation of <= 1000 eV electrons in an atmosphere of CO2, which is one of the most abundant species in Mars' and Venus's atmospheres. The e-CO2 cross sections are presented in an assembled set along with their analytical representations. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out at several energies to calculate the "yield spectra,'' which embodied all the information related to the electron degradation process and can be used to calculate "yield'' (or population) for any inelastic process. The numerical yield spectra have been fitted analytically, resulting in an analytical yield spectra. We have calculated the mean energy per ion pair and efficiencies for various inelastic processes, including the double and dissociative double ionization of CO2 and negative ion formation. The energy distribution of the secondary electrons produced per incident electron is also presented at few incident energies. The mean energy per ion pair for CO2 is 37.5 (35.8) eV at 200 (1000) eV, compared to the experimental value 32.7 eV at high energies. Ionization is the dominant loss process at energies above 50 eV with a contribution of similar to 50%. Among the excitation processes, 13.6 eV and 12.4 eV states are the dominant loss processes consuming similar to 28% energy above 200 eV. Around and below ionization threshold, 13.6 eV, 12.4 eV, and 11.1 eV, followed by 8.6 eV and 9.3 eV, excitation states are important loss processes, while below 10 eV, vibrational excitation dominates.

AB An objective classification of the globular clusters (GCs) of NGC 5128 has been carried out by using a model-based approach of cluster analysis. The set of observable parameters includes structural parameters, spectroscopically determined Lick indices and radial velocities from the literature. The optimum set of parameters for this type of analysis is selected through a modified technique of principal component analysis, which differs from the classical one in the sense that it takes into consideration the effects of outliers present in the data. Then a mixture model based approach has been used to classify the GCs into groups. The efficiency of the techniques used is tested through the comparison of the misclassification probabilities with those obtained using the K-means clustering technique. On the basis of the above classification scheme three coherent groups of GCs have been found. We propose that the clusters of one group originated in the original cluster formation event that coincided with the formation of the elliptical galaxy, and that the clusters of the two other groups are of external origin, from tidally stripped dwarf galaxies on random orbits around NGC 5128 for one group, and from an accreted spiral galaxy for the other.

AB Normal modes of oscillation of the Sun are useful probes of the solar interior. In this work, we use the even order splitting coefficients to study the evolution of magnetic fields in the convection zone over solar cycle 23, assuming that the frequency splitting is only due to rotation and a large-scale magnetic field. We find that the data are best fit by a combination of a poloidal field and a double-peaked near-surface toroidal field. The toroidal fields are centered at r(0) = 0.999 R-circle dot and r = 0.996 R-circle dot and are confined to the near-surface layers. The poloidal field is a dipole field. The peak strength of the poloidal field is 124 +/- 17 G. The toroidal field peaks at 380 +/- 30 G and 1.4 +/- 0.2 kG for the shallower and deeper fields, respectively. The field strengths are highly correlated with surface activity. The toroidal field strength shows a hysteresis-like effect when compared to the global 10.7 cm radio flux. The poloidal field strength shows evidence of saturation at high activity.

AB In this paper we study the off-electrojet low-latitude daytime E region plasma irregularities using first multi-instrument observations in India made during July 2004 by the MST radar from Gadanki (13.5 degrees N, 79.2 degrees E, magnetic latitude 6.4 degrees N), Langmuir probe on board the RH-300 Mk II rocket, and ionosonde from Sriharikota (13.6 degrees N, 80.2 degrees E, magnetic latitude 6.4 degrees N). Radar echoes were confined to altitudes below 105 km and were observed in the form of a descending echoing layer with the descent rate of 1 km/h. Virtual height of the E layer, as observed by ionosonde, shows identical descending behavior. A detailed analysis based on the radar and ionosonde observations shows that the radar echoes are related to the range spread in the ionogram. Rocket observations made on 23 July 2004 revealed weak plasma irregularities with scale sizes more than 100 m and no noticeable irregularity at shorter scales. The spectral slope of the irregularities observed by the rocket probe is found to be -4 for scales in between 1 km and 100 m. During the rocket launch, radar did not detect any echo conforming that the small-scale irregularities were not present. Examination of concurrent observations of neutral wind made by TIMED Doppler interferometry suggests that zonal wind plays a crucial role in forming electron density layers, which become unstable via the gradient drift instability with background electric field or/and zonal neutral wind generating low-latitude E region plasma irregularities.

AB Rayleigh optical depth is an integral part of many radiative transfer problems. This paper discusses different elements and approaches of its determination. Then, it presents a method, which ensures more realistic estimate of Rayleigh optical depth by using refractive index and depolarization factor (including rotational Raman lines) adjusted according to the state and composition of the atmosphere. It is based on the published experimental and theoretical results. The Rayleigh optical depth calculations are compared with the Elterman's model calculations for trend analysis purpose. Rayleigh optical depths are found to be around 3.4% lower than previous researchers, as they ignored the constraints of conservation of angular momentum in the rotational/vibrational transitions of the molecules during scattering.

AB The experimentally measured ground level atmospheric electrical conductivity is validated from a simplified ion-aerosol model for which the inputs are ionization rate from surface radioactivity, aerosol density and meteorological parameters. Also estimated from the model is the reduction in conductivity for assumed aerosol levels. It is seen that for an increase of ambient aerosols by threefold the percent reduction in conductivity is 7% and it is 10% for all increase by sixfold. Thus, the variations in the measured ground level conductivity can be used to examine the atmospheric pollution, if any. (C) 2009 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Context. MGRO J2019+37 is an unidentified extended source of very high energy gamma-rays originally reported by the Milagro Collaboration as the brightest TeV source in the Cygnus region. Its extended emission could be powered by either a single or several sources. The GeV pulsar AGL J2020.5+3653, discovered by AGILE and associated with PSR J2021+3651, could contribute to the emission from MGRO J2019+37.
   Aims. Our aim is to identify radio and near-infrared sources in the field of the extended TeV source MGRO J2019+37, and study potential counterparts to explain its emission.
   Methods. We surveyed a region of about 6 square degrees with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at the frequency 610 MHz. We also observed the central square degree of this survey in the near-infrared K(s)-band using the 3.5 m telescope in Calar Alto. Archival X-ray observations of some specific fields are included. VLBI observations of an interesting radio source were performed. We explored possible scenarios to produce the multi-TeV emission from MGRO J2019+37 and studied which of the sources could be the main particle accelerator.
   Results. We present a catalogue of 362 radio sources detected with the GMRT in the field of MGRO J2019+37, and the results of a cross-correlation of this catalog with one obtained at near-infrared wavelengths, which contains similar to 3 x 10(5) sources, as well as with available X-ray observations of the region. Some peculiar sources inside the similar to 1 degrees uncertainty region of the TeV emission from MGRO J2019+37 are discussed in detail, including the pulsar PSR J2021+3651 and its pulsar wind nebula PWN G75.2+0.1, two new radio-jet sources, the HII region Sh 2-104 containing two star clusters, and the radio source NVSS J202032+363158. We also find that the hadronic scenario is the most likely in case of a single accelerator, and discuss the possible contribution from the sources mentioned above.
   Conclusions. Although the radio and GeV pulsar PSR J2021+3651 / AGL J2020.5+3653 and its associated pulsar wind nebula PWN G75.2+0.1 can contribute to the emission from MGRO J2019+37, extrapolation of the GeV spectrum does not explain the detected multi-TeV flux. Other sources discussed here could contribute to the emission of the Milagro source.

AB Context. BL Lacertae is the prototype of the blazar subclass named after it. Yet, it has occasionally shown a peculiar behaviour that has questioned a simple interpretation of its broad-band emission in terms of synchrotron plus synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation. Aims. In the 2007-2008 observing season we carried out a new multiwavelength campaign of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) on BL Lacertae, involving three pointings by the XMM-Newton satellite in July and December 2007, and January 2008, to study its emission properties, particularly in the optical-X-ray energy range.
   Methods. The source was monitored in the optical-to-radio bands by 37 telescopes. The brightness level was relatively low. Some episodes of very fast variability were detected in the optical bands. Flux changes had larger amplitude at the higher radio frequencies than at longer wavelengths.
   Results. The X-ray spectra acquired by the EPIC instrument onboard XMM-Newton are well fitted by a power law with photon index Gamma similar to 2 and photoelectric absorption exceeding the Galactic value. However, when taking into account the presence of a molecular cloud on the line of sight, the EPIC data are best fitted by a double power law, implying a concave X-ray spectrum. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) built with simultaneous radio-to-X-ray data at the epochs of the XMM-Newton observations suggest that the peak of the synchrotron emission lies in the near-IR band, and show a prominent UV excess, besides a slight soft-X-ray excess. A comparison with the SEDs corresponding to previous observations with X-ray satellites shows that the X-ray spectrum is very variable, since it can change from extremely steep to extremely hard, and can be more or less curved in intermediate states. We ascribe the UV excess to thermal emission from the accretion disc, and the other broad-band spectral features to the presence of two synchrotron components, with their related SSC emission. We fit the thermal emission with a black body law and the non-thermal components by means of a helical jet model. The fit indicates a disc temperature greater than or similar to 20 000 K and a luminosity greater than or similar to 6 x 10(44) erg s(-1).

AB Context. Solar-like oscillations have now been observed in several stars, thanks to ground-based spectroscopic observations and space-borne photometry. CoRoT, which has been in orbit since December 2006, has observed the star HD49933 twice. The oscillation spectrum of this star has proven difficult to interpret.
   Aims. Thanks to a new timeseries provided by CoRoT, we aim to provide a robust description of the oscillations in HD49933, i.e., to identify the degrees of the observed modes, and to measure mode frequencies, widths, amplitudes and the average rotational splitting.
   Methods. Several methods were used to model the Fourier spectrum: Maximum Likelihood Estimators and Bayesian analysis using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo techniques.
   Results. The different methods yield consistent result, and allow us to make a robust identification of the modes and to extract precise mode parameters. Only the rotational splitting remains difficult to estimate precisely, but is clearly relatively large (several mu Hz in size).

AB Context. Hierarchal models of large-scale structure (LSS) formation predict that galaxy clusters grow via gravitational infall and mergers of smaller subclusters and galaxy groups. Diffuse radio emission, in the form of radio halos and relics, is found in clusters undergoing a merger, indicating that shocks or turbulence associated with the merger are capable of accelerating electrons to highly relativistic energies. Double relics are a rare class of radio sources found in the periphery of clusters, with the two components located symmetrically on the opposite sides of the cluster center. These relics are important probes of the cluster periphery as (i) they provide an estimate of the magnetic field strength, and (ii) together with detailed modeling can be used to derive information about the merger geometry, mass, and timescale. Observations of these double relics can thus be used to test the framework of LSS formation. Here we report on radio observations of ZwCl 2341.1+0000, a complex merging structure of galaxies located at z = 0.27, using Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations.
   Aims. The main aim of the observations is to study the nature of the diffuse radio emission in the galaxy cluster ZwCl 2341.1+0000.
   Methods. We carried out GMRT 610, 241, and 157 MHz continuum observations of ZwCl 2341.1+0000. The radio observations are combined with X-ray and optical data of the cluster.
   Results. The GMRT observations show a double peripheral radio relic in the cluster ZwCl 2341.1+0000. The spectral index is -0.49 +/- 0.18 for the northern relic and -0.76 +/- 0.17 for the southern relic. We have derived values of 0.48-0.93 mu Gauss for the equipartition magnetic field strength. The relics are probably associated with outward traveling merger shock waves.

AB Context. Discovery of the 6.7-h periodicity in the X-ray source 1E 161348-5055 in RCW 103 has led to investigations of the nature of this periodicity.
   Aims. To explore a model for 1E 161348-5055 wherein a fast-spinning neutron star with a magnetic field similar to 10(12) G in a young pre-low-mass X-ray Binary (pre-LMXB) with an eccentric orbit of period 6.7 h operates in the "propeller" phase.
   Methods. The 6.7-h light curve of 1E 161348-5055 is modeled in terms of orbitally-modulated mass transfer through a viscous accretion disk and subsequent propeller emission. Formation of eccentric binaries in supernovae and their subsequent tidal evolution are studied.
   Results. The light curve of 1E 161348-5055 can be quantitatively accounted for by models of propeller torques of both Illarionov-Sunyaev type and Romanova-Lovelace et al. type, and spectral and other properties are also in agreement. Formation and evolution of model systems are shown to be in accordance both with standard theories and with X-ray observations of 1E 161348-5055.
   Conclusions. The pre-LMXB model for 1E 161348-5055 and similar sources agrees with observation. Distinguishing features between this model and the recently-proposed magnetar model need to be explored.

AB We report a possible detection of an similar to 4.6-h quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the 0.3-10 keV emission of the high-energy peaked blazar PKS 2155-304 from a 64 ks observation by the XMM-Newton EPIC/pn detector. We identify a total modulation of similar to 5% in the light curve and confirm that nominal period by periodogram, structure function, and wavelet analyses. The limited light curve duration allows the capture of only 3.8 cycles of this oscillation and thus precludes a very strong claim for this QPO, despite a nominally high (greater than or similar to 3 sigma) statistical significance. We briefly discuss models capable of producing an X-ray QPO of such a period in a blazar.

AB We report combined optical and X-ray observations of nova M31N 2007-12b. Optical spectroscopy obtained 5 days after the 2007 December outburst shows evidence of very high ejection velocities (FWHM H alpha similar or equal to 4500 km s(-1)). In addition, Swift X-ray data show that M31N 2007-12b is associated with a Super-Soft Source (SSS) which appeared between 21 and 35 days post-outburst and turned off between then and day 169. Our analysis implies that M(WD) greater than or similar to 1.3 M(circle dot) in this system. The optical light curve, spectrum, and X-ray behavior are consistent with those of a recurrent nova. Hubble Space Telescope observations of the pre-outburst location of M31N 2007-12b reveal the presence of a coincident stellar source with magnitude and color very similar to the Galactic recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi at quiescence, where the red giant secondary dominates the emission. We believe that this is the first occasion on which a nova progenitor system has been identified in M31. However, the greatest similarities of outburst optical spectrum and SSS behavior are with the supposed Galactic recurrent nova V2491 Cygni. A previously implied association of M31N 2007-12b with nova M31N 1969-08a is shown to be erroneous, and this has important lessons for future searches for recurrent novae in extragalactic systems. Overall, we show that suitable complementary X-ray and optical observations can be used not only to identify recurrent nova candidates in M31, but also to determine subtypes and important physical parameters of these systems. Prospects are therefore good for extending studies of recurrent novae into the Local Group with the potential to explore in more detail such important topics as their proposed link to Type Ia Supernovae.

AB We report evidence for an anti-correlation between spin temperature T(s) and metallicity [Z/H], detected at 3.6 sigma significance in a sample of 26 damped Ly alpha absorbers (DLAs) at redshifts 0.09 < z < 3.45. The anti-correlation is detected at 3 sigma significance in a sub-sample of 20 DLAs with measured covering factors, implying that it does not stem from low covering factors. We obtain T(s) = (-0.68 +/- 0.17) x [Z/H] + (2.13 +/- 0.21) from a linear regression analysis. Our results indicate that the high T(s) values found in DLAs do not arise from differences between the optical and radio sightlines, but are likely to reflect the underlying gas temperature distribution. The trend between T(s) and [Z/H] can be explained by the larger number of radiation pathways for gas cooling in galaxies with high metal abundances, resulting in a high cold gas fraction, and hence, a low spin temperature. Conversely, low-metallicity galaxies have fewer cooling routes, yielding a larger warm gas fraction and a high T(s). Most DLAs at z > 1.7 have low metallicities, [Z/H] < -1, implying that the Hi in high-z DLAs is predominantly warm. The anti-correlation between T(s) and [Z/H] is consistent with the presence of a mass-metallicity relation in DLAs, suggested by the tight correlation between DLA metallicity and the kinematic widths of metal lines. Most high-z DLAs are likely to arise in galaxies with low masses (M(vir) < 10(10.5)M(circle dot)), low metallicities ([Z/H] < -1), and low cold gas fractions.

AB The solar irradiance data plays a very important role for understanding of Solar internal Structure and the solar terrestrial relationships. The Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) is integrated solar energy flux over the entire spectrum which arrives at the top of the atmosphere at the mean sun earth distance. TSI has been monitored from several satellites, e.g. Nimbus 7, Solar Maximum Mission (SMM), The NASA, Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS), NOAA9, NOAA10, Eureca and the Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite (UARS) etc. From these observations it reveals that the total solar irradiance varies about a small fraction of 0.1 over solar cycle being higher during maximum solar activity condition. In the present paper we have analysed the solar irradiance data from ERBS during the time period from October 15, 1984 to October 15, 2003. First filtering the data by Simple Exponential Smoothing we have applied the Rayleigh Power Spectrum Analysis on the processed data in order to search for its time variation. Study exhibits multi-periodicities on these data around 7, 11, 42, 80, 104, 130, 160, 254, 536, 752, 1142, 1388, 2474 and 4951 days with very high confidence levels (more than 95%). Apart from these strong periods there are some other weak periods around 22, 47, 53, 67, 69, 149, 167, 365, 489 and 683 days. These periods are significantly similar with the periods of other solar activities which may suggest that solar irradiance may be associated with other solar activities.

This model can successfully explain the accelerated expansion of the universe given that it satisfies a certain condition. Here we have considered the modified Chaplygin gas as the dynamically changing part of the dark energy component of our universe. Chaplygin gas provides early deceleration and late time acceleration of the universe. The graphical representation of statefinder parameters shows that the total evolution of the universe starts from radiation era to phantom model.

AB The pre-Deep Impact images of Comet Tempel-1 obtained at the Indian Astronomical Observatory are used to investigate the morphology of the dust coma of the comet. We show that the trajectory of a cometary grain under the influence of solar radiation pressure is a reliable diagnostic to estimate its initial velocity. Four main active regions at mean latitudes +45 degrees +/- 5 degrees(D), 0 degrees +/- 5 degrees (E),-30 degrees +/- 5 degrees(A) and -60 degrees +- 5 degrees(F) are found to explain the morphology of the dust coma in the ground-based and published images obtained by the High Resolution Instrument(HRI) cameras aboard the Deep Impact flyby spacecraft. From a chi(2) fit of the intensity distribution in the observed and the simulated images, we derive the fraction of the productivity of the active vents to the total dust emission of the comet to be 27%. Of this the southern source alone accounts for 19.8%. The grains are found to be ejected with a velocity distribution with an upper limit of 70 +/- 7 m s(-1). However, the broad region 'A' appears to eject slower grains with an upper limit of 24 +/- 2.5 m s(-1). This source, that is active throughout the cycle is likely to be driven by CO(2) sublimit limation. We compute the dependence of the percentage contribution of the southern source on the heliocentric distance and show that this ratio varies over the apparition and reaches a maximum at around 260 days before perihelion. The published images of the nucleus of Comet Tempel-1 show significant departure from sphericity. Therefore, the torque exerted by the enhanced activity of the southern region may be significant enough to produce changes in the rotational state of the nucleus before each perihelion passage.

AB We compute the effects of thermal Comptonization of soft photons emitted from a Keplerian disk around a black hole by the postshock region of a sub-Keplerian flow, known as the CENtrifugal-pressure-dominated BOundary Layer (CENBOL). We show that the spectral state transitions of black hole candidates could be explained either by varying the outer boundary of the CENBOL, which also happens to be the inner edge of the Keplerian disk, or by changing the central density of the CENBOL, which is governed by the rate of the sub-Keplerian flow. We confirm the conclusions of the previous theoretical studies that the interplay between the intensity of the soft photons emitted by the Keplerian flow, the optical depth and electron temperature of the Comptonizing cloud is responsible for the state transitions in a black hole.

We show that : (a) T h e global HI signal can only be seen in emission, unlike in the standard Lambda CDM models, (b) the density perturbations induced by primordial fields, leave distinctive signatures of the magnetic field Jeans' length on the HI two-point correlation function, (c) the length scale of ionization in homogeneities is less than or similar to 1 Mpc. We find that the peak expected signal (two-point correlation function) is similar or equal to 10(-4) K-2 in the range of scales 0.5-3 Mpc for magnetic field strength in the range 5 x 10(-10)-3 x 10(-9) G. We also discuss the detectability of the HI signal. The angular resolution of the on-going and planned radio interferometers allows one to probe only the largest magnetic field strengths that we consider. They have the sensitivity to detect the magnetic field-induced features. We show that the future SKA has both the angular resolution and the sensitivity to detect the magnetic field-induced signal in the entire range of magnetic field values we consider, in and integration time of one week.

AB We present the results of our intra-night optical flux monitoring observations of S5 0716+714 done simultaneously in g', R-C and I-C filters. The observations were done using the Multicolor Imaging Telescopes for Survey and Monstrous Explosions instrument on the 50 cm telescope at the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory over 30 nights between 2008 March 11 and 2008 May 8. Of these 30 nights, 22 nights have continuous (without any break) observations with the duration ranging from 1 to 6 h and hence were considered for intra-night optical variability (INOV). The remaining eight nights have continuous observations of less than 1 h and hence were considered only for long-term optical variability. In total, we have 4888 data points which were simultaneous in g', R-C and I-C filters. Of the 22 nights considered for INOV, the object showed flux variability on 19 nights with the amplitude of variability in the I-C band ranging from similar to 4 per cent to similar to 55 per cent. The duty cycle for INOV was thus found to be 83 per cent. A good correlation between the light curves in all the three bands was found. No time lag between different bands was noticed on most of the nights, except for three nights where the variation in g' was found to lead that of the I-C band by 0.3 to 1.5 h. On inter-night time-scales, no lag was found between g' and I-C bands. On inter-night time-scales as well as intra-night time-scales on most of the nights, the amplitude of variability was found to increase towards shorter wavelengths. The flux variations in the different bands were not achromatic, with the blazar tending to become bluer when brighter on both inter-night and intra-night time-scales, and this might be attributed to the larger amplitude variation at shorter wavelengths. A clear periodic variation of 3.3 h was found on 2008 April 1 and a hint for another possible periodic variability of 4 h was found on 2008 March 31. During our 30 days of observations over a 2 month period, the source has varied with an amplitude of variability as large as similar to 80 per cent.

AB We used observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to measure the atomic hydrogen gas content of 324 galaxies around the galaxy cluster Abell 370 at a redshift of z = 0.37 (a look-back time of similar to 4 billion years). The H i 21 cm emission from these galaxies was measured by co-adding their signals using precise optical redshifts obtained with the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The average H i mass measured for all 324 galaxies is (6.6 +/- 3.5) x 109 M-circle dot, while the average H i mass measured for the 105 optically blue galaxies is (19.0 +/- 6.5) x 109 M-circle dot. The significant quantities of gas found around Abell 370 suggest that there has been substantial evolution in the gas content of galaxy clusters since redshift z = 0.37. The total amount of atomic hydrogen gas found around Abell 370 is up to approximately eight times more than that seen around the Coma cluster, a nearby galaxy cluster of similar size. Despite this higher gas content, Abell 370 shows the same trend as nearby clusters that galaxies close to the cluster core have lower H i gas content than galaxies further away where the galaxy density is lower. The optically blue galaxies contain the majority of the H i gas surrounding the cluster. However, there is evidence that the optically red galaxies contain appreciable quantities of H i gas within their central regions. The Abell 370 galaxies have H i mass-to-optical-light ratios similar to local galaxy samples and have the same correlation between their star formation rate and H i mass as found in the nearby galaxies. The average star formation rate derived from [O ii] emission and from deredshifted 1.4 GHz radio continuum for the Abell 370 galaxies also follows the correlation found in the local Universe. The large amounts of H i gas found around the cluster can easily be consumed entirely by the observed star formation rate in the galaxies over similar to 4 billion years (from z = 0.37) to the present day. Abell 370 appears set to evolve into a gas-poor system similar to galaxy clusters observed in the local Universe.

AB We present the result of our extensive intranight optical monitoring of the well-known low-energy peaked BL Lac (LBL) object PKS 0735+178. This long-term follow-up consists of R-band monitoring for a minimum duration of similar to 4 hours, on 17 nights spanning 11 years (1998-2008). Using the CCD as an N-star photometer, a detection limit of around 1 per cent was attained for the intranight optical variability (INOV). Remarkably, an INOV amplitude of >= 3 per cent on hour-like time-scale was not observed on any of the 17 nights, even though the likelihood of a typical LBL showing such INOV levels in a single session of greater than or similar to 4 hours duration is known to be high (similar to 50 per cent). Our observations have thus established a peculiar long-term INOV quiescence of this radio-selected BL Lac object. Moreover, the access to unpublished optical monitoring data of similarly high sensitivity, acquired in another programme, has allowed us to confirm the same anomalous INOV quiescence of this LBL all the way back to 1989, the epoch of its historically largest radio outburst. Here, we present observational evidence revealing the very unusual INOV behaviour of this classical BL Lac object and discuss this briefly in the context of its other known exceptional properties.

AB We employ an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based technique to develop a pipeline for automated segregation of stars from the galaxies to be observed by Tel-Aviv University Ultra-Violet Experiment (TAU-VEX). We use synthetic spectra of stars from UVBLUE library and selected International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) low-resolution spectra for galaxies in the ultraviolet (UV) region from 1250 to 3220 A as the training set and IUE low-resolution spectra for both the stars and the galaxies as the test set. All the data sets have been pre-processed to get band integrated fluxes so as to mimic the observations of the TAUVEX UV imager. We also perform the ANN based segregation scheme using the full length spectral features (which will also be useful for the ASTROSAT mission). Our results suggest that, in the case of the non-availability of full spectral features, the limited band integrated features can be used to segregate the two classes of objects: although the band data classification is less accurate than the full spectral data classification.

TI Search for gravitational-wave bursts in the first year of the fifth LIGO
   science run

DT Article
ID DETECTORS; COLLAPSE
AB We present the results obtained from an all-sky search for gravitational-wave (GW) bursts in the 64-2000 Hz frequency range in data collected by the LIGO detectors during the first year (November 2005-November 2006) of their fifth science run. The total analyzed live time was 268.6 days. Multiple hierarchical data analysis methods were invoked in this search. The overall sensitivity expressed in terms of the root-sum-square (rss) strain amplitude h(rss) for gravitational-wave bursts with various morphologies was in the range of 6x10(-22) Hz(-1/2) to a fewx10(-21) Hz(-1/2). No GW signals were observed and a frequentist upper limit of 3.75 events per year on the rate of strong GW bursts was placed at the 90% confidence level. As in our previous searches, we also combined this rate limit with the detection efficiency for selected waveform morphologies to obtain event rate versus strength exclusion curves. In sensitivity, these exclusion curves are the most stringent to date.

ID VIRGO
AB We present an all-sky search for gravitational waves in the frequency range 1 to 6 kHz during the first calendar year of LIGO's fifth science run. This is the first untriggered LIGO burst analysis to be conducted above 3 kHz. We discuss the unique properties of interferometric data in this regime. 161.3 days of triple-coincident data were analyzed. No gravitational events above threshold were observed and a frequentist upper limit of 5.4 year(-1) on the rate of strong gravitational-wave bursts was placed at a 90% confidence level. Implications for specific theoretical models of gravitational-wave emission are also discussed.

AB We present a k-essence model where a single scalar field is responsible for the early expansion of the Universe through the process of k inflation and at appropriate subsequent stages acts both as dark matter and dark energy. The Lagrangian contains a potential for the scalar field as well as a noncanonical kinetic term, and is of the form F(X)V(phi) which has been widely used as a k-essence Lagrangian. After the period of inflation is over the model can be approximated as purely kinetic k essence, generating dark matter and dark energy at late times. We show how observational results are used to put constraints on the parameters of this model.

AB We show that a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type four-fermion coupling at the z=3 Lifshitz-like fixed point in 3+1 dimensions is asymptotically free and generates a mass scale dynamically. This result is nonperturbative in the limit of a large number of fermion species. The theory is ultraviolet complete and at low energies exhibits Lorentz invariance as an emergent spacetime symmetry. Many of our results generalize to z=d in odd d spatial dimensions; z=d=1 corresponds to the Gross-Neveu model. The above mechanism of mass generation has potential applications to the fermion mass problem and to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. We present a scenario in which a composite Higgs field arises from a condensate of these fermions, which then couples to quarks and leptons of the standard model. Such a scenario could eliminate the need for the Higgs potential and the associated hierarchy problem. We also show that the axial anomaly formula at z=3 coincides with the usual one in the relativistic domain.

TI Is cosmic acceleration slowing down?
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID DARK ENERGY; LIGHT CURVES; CONSTRAINTS; CFA
AB We investigate the course of cosmic expansion in its recent past using the Constitution SN Ia sample, along with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Allowing the equation of state of dark energy (DE) to vary, we find that a coasting model of the universe (q(0)=0) fits the data about as well as Lambda cold dark matter. This effect, which is most clearly seen using the recently introduced Om diagnostic, corresponds to an increase of Om and q at redshifts z less than or similar to 0.3. This suggests that cosmic acceleration may have already peaked and that we are currently witnessing its slowing down. The case for evolving DE strengthens if a subsample of the Constitution set consisting of SNLS+ESSENCE+CfA SN Ia data is analyzed in combination with BAO+CMB data. The effect we observe could correspond to DE decaying into dark matter (or something else).

ID FIELDS
AB We develop a model of the fluctuation dynamo in which the magnetic field is confined to thin flux ropes advected by a multiscale model of turbulence. Magnetic dissipation occurs only via reconnection of the flux ropes. This model can be viewed as an implementation of the asymptotic limit R(m)->infinity for a continuous magnetic field, where magnetic dissipation is strongly localized to small regions of strong-field gradients. We investigate the kinetic-energy release into heat mediated by the dynamo action, both in our model and by solving the induction equation with the same flow. We find that a flux-rope dynamo is an order of magnitude more efficient at converting mechanical energy into heat. The probability density of the magnetic energy release in reconnections has a power-law form with the slope -3, consistent with the solar corona heating by nanoflares.

AB The origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB) is still an open question, even nearly forty years after its discovery. The emission could originate either from truly diffuse processes or from unresolved point sources. Although the majority of the 271 point sources detected by EGRET (Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope) are unidentified, of the identified sources, blazars are the dominant candidates. Therefore, unresolved blazars may be considered the main contributor to the EGRB, and many studies have been carried out to understand their distribution, evolution and contribution to the EGRB. Considering that gamma-ray emission comes mostly from jets of blazars and that the jet emission decreases rapidly with increasing jet to line-of-sight angle, it is not surprising that EGRET was not able to detect many large inclination angle active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Though Fermi could only detect a few large inclination angle AGNs during the first three months of its survey, it is expected to detect many such sources in the near future. Since non-blazar AGNs are expected to have higher density as compared to blazars, these could also contribute significantly to the EGRB. In this paper, we discuss contributions from unresolved discrete sources including normal galaxies, starburst galaxies, blazars and off-axis AGNs to the EGRB.

AB We obtained the images of the eastern part of the solar corona in the Fe xiv 530.3 nm (green) and Fe x 637.4 nm (red) coronal emission lines during the total solar eclipse of 29 March 2006 at Manavgat, Antalya, Turkey. The images were obtained using a 35 cm Meade telescope equipped with a Peltier-cooled 2k x 2k CCD and 0.3 nm pass-band interference filters at the rates of 2.95 s (exposure times of 100 ms) and 2.0 s (exposure times of 300 ms) in the Fe xiv and Fe x emission lines, respectively. The analysis of the data indicates intensity variations at some locations with period of strongest power around 27 s for the green line and 20 s for the red line. These results confirm earlier findings of variations in the continuum intensity with periods in the range of 5 to 56 s by Singh et al. (Solar Phys. 170, 235, 1997). The wavelet analysis has been used to identify significant intensity oscillations at all pixels within our field of view. Significant oscillations with high probability estimates were detected for some locations only. These locations seem to follow the boundary of an active region and in the neighborhood, rather than within the loops themselves. These intensity oscillations may be caused by fast magneto-sonic waves in the solar corona and partly account for heating of the plasma in the corona.

AB Precursor techniques, in particular those using geomagnetic indices, often are used in the prediction of the maximum amplitude for a sunspot cycle. Here, the year 2008 is taken as being the sunspot minimum year for cycle 24. Based on the average aa index value for the year of the sunspot minimum and the preceding four years, we estimate the expected annual maximum amplitude for cycle 24 to be about 92.8 +/- 19.6 (1-sigma accuracy), indicating a somewhat weaker cycle 24 as compared to cycles 21 -aEuro parts per thousand 23. Presuming a smoothed monthly mean sunspot number minimum in August 2008, a smoothed monthly mean sunspot number maximum is expected about October 2012 +/- 4 months (1-sigma accuracy).

AB In order to understand the substantial variation of sodium (Na) airglow intensity from one night to another, a case study is performed using simultaneous, campaign-based measurements of Na airglow and Na lidar during March 2007 from Gadanki (13.5 degrees N, 79.2 degrees E), India, during postmidnight hours. The altitude profiles of mesospheric ozone, temperature, and pressure available for the nearest location during the local postmidnight hours are also obtained from the SABER instrument on board the TIMED satellite and are used in conjunction with the above measurements. The average Na airglow intensity level on 20 March 2007 is found to be less compared to that on the next night despite average Na concentration being larger by at least a factor of three. In order to explain the observation, volume emission rates of Na airglow are calculated for both of the nights using the measured parameters. The enhanced quenching due to the ambient gas is suggested to be responsible for the reduced Na airglow intensity level on 20 March 2007 despite higher Na concentration.

AB We present detailed observations of MRC 0116+111, revealing a luminous, miniradio halo of similar to 240-kpc diameter located at the centre of a cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 0.131. Our optical and multiwavelength Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and Very Large Array radio observations reveal a highly unusual radio source: showing a pair of giant (similar to 100-kpc diameter) bubble-like diffuse structures, that are about three times larger than the analogous extended radio emission observed in M87 - the dominant central radio galaxy in the Virgo cluster. However, in MRC 0116+111 we do not detect any ongoing active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, such as a compact core or active radio jets feeding the plasma bubbles. The radio emitting relativistic particles and magnetic fields were probably seeded in the past by a pair of radio jets originating in the AGN of the central cD galaxy. The extremely steep high-frequency radio spectrum of the north-western bubble, located similar to 100 kpc from cluster centre, indicates radiation losses, possibly because having detached, it is rising buoyantly and moving away into the putative hot intracluster medium. The other bubble, closer to the cluster centre, shows signs of ongoing particle re-acceleration. We estimate that the radio jets which inflated these two bubbles might have also fed enough energy into the intracluster medium to create an enormous system of cavities and shock fronts, and to drive a massive outflow from the AGN, which could counter-balance and even quench a cooling flow. Therefore, this source presents an excellent opportunity to understand the energetics and the dynamical evolution of radio jet inflated plasma bubbles in the hot cluster atmosphere.

AB The single glitch observed in PSR B1821-24, a millisecond pulsar in M28, is unusual on two counts. First, the magnitude of this glitch is at least an order of magnitude smaller (delta nu/nu similar to 10-11) than the smallest glitch observed to date. Secondly, all other glitching pulsars have strong magnetic fields with B greater than or similar to 1011 G and are young, whereas PSR B1821-24 is an old recycled pulsar with a field strength of 2.25 x 109 G. We have earlier suggested that some of the recycled pulsars could actually be strange quark stars. In this work, we argue that the crustal properties of such a strange pulsar are just right to give rise to a glitch of this magnitude, explaining the scarcity of larger glitches in millisecond pulsars.

AB In this paper, we investigate the solar cycle variation of coronal null points and magnetic breakout configurations in spherical geometry, using a combination of magnetic flux transport and potential field source surface models. Within the simulations, a total of 2843 coronal null points and breakout configurations are found over two solar cycles. It is found that the number of coronal nulls present at any time varies cyclically throughout the solar cycle, in phase with the flux emergence rate. At cycle maximum, peak values of 15-17 coronal nulls per day are found. No significant variation in the number of nulls is found from the rising to the declining phase. This indicates that the magnetic breakout model is applicable throughout both phases of the solar cycle. In addition, it is shown that when the simulations are used to construct synoptic data sets, such as those produced by Kitt Peak, the number of coronal nulls drops by a factor of 1/6. The vast majority of the coronal nulls are found to lie above the active latitudes and are the result of the complex nature of the underlying active region fields. Only 8% of the coronal nulls are found to be connected to the global dipole. Another interesting feature is that 18% of coronal nulls are found to lie above the equator due to cross-equatorial interactions between bipoles lying in the northern and southern hemispheres. As the majority of coronal nulls form above active latitudes, their average radial extent is found to be in the low corona below 1.25 R-circle dot (175,000 km above the photosphere). Through considering the underlying photospheric flux, it is found that 71% of coronal nulls are produced though quadrupolar flux distributions resulting from bipoles in the same hemisphere interacting. When the number of coronal nulls present in each rotation is compared to the number of bipoles emerging, a wide scatter is found. The ratio of coronal nulls to emerging bipoles is found to be approximately 1/3. Overall, the spatio-temporal evolution of coronal nulls is found to follow the typical solar butterfly diagram and is in qualitative agreement with the observed time dependence of coronal mass ejection source-region locations.

AB For a large class of dark energy (DE) models, for which the effective gravitational constant is a constant and there is no direct exchange of energy between DE and dark matter (DM), knowledge of the expansion history suffices to reconstruct the growth factor of linearized density perturbations in the non-relativistic matter component on scales much smaller than the Hubble distance. In this paper, we develop a non-parametric-method for extracting information about the perturbative growth factor from data pertaining to the luminosity or angular size distances. A comparison of the reconstructed density contrast with observations of large-scale structure and gravitational lensing can help distinguish DE models such as the cosmological constant and quintessence from models based on modified gravity theories as well as models in which DE and DM are either unified or interact directly. We show that for current supernovae (SNe) data, the linear growth factor at z = 0.3 can be constrained to 5% and the linear growth rate to 6%. With future SNe data, such as expected from the Joint Dark Energy Mission, we may be able to constrain the growth factor to 2%-3% and the growth rate to 3%-4% at z = 0.3 with this unbiased, model-independent reconstruction method. For future baryon acoustic oscillation data which would deliver measurements of both the angular diameter distance and the Hubble parameter, it should be possible to constrain the growth factor at z = 2.5%-9%. These constraints grow tighter with the errors on the data sets. With a large quantity of data expected in the next few years, this method can emerge as a competitive tool for distinguishing between different models of dark energy.

AB Here, we explore the nature of small-scale jet-like structures and their possible relation to explosive events and other known transient features, like spicules and macrospicules, using high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation instrument. We present a highly resolved spectroscopic analysis and line parameter study of time-series data for jets occurring on-disk and off-limb in both a northern and a southern coronal hole. The analysis reveals many small-scale transients which rapidly propagate between the mid-transition region (N IV 765 angstrom line formation: 140,000 K) and the lower corona (Ne VIII 770 angstrom line formation: 630,000 K). In one example, a strong jet-like event is associated with a cool feature not present in the Ne VIII 770 angstrom line radiance or Doppler velocity maps. Another similar event is observed, but with a hot component, which could be perceived as a blinker. Our data reveal fast, repetitive plasma outflows with blueshift velocities of approximate to 145 km s(-1) in the lower solar atmosphere. The data suggest a strong role for smaller jets (spicules), as a precursor to macrospicule formation, which may have a common origin with explosive events.

TI COMBINING THE TUNNELING AND ANOMALY PHENOMENA IN DERIVING THE

ID BLACK-HOLES; HAWKING RADIATION; DIRAC SEA; QUANTUM; GAUGE; FERMIONS
AB In the present work we have derived the gravitational anomaly from a fundamentally different perspective: it emerges due to the tunneling of particles (in the present case fermions) across the black hole horizon. The latter effect is in fact the Hawking radiation. We have used the analogy of an early idea(17,18) of visualizing chiral gauge anomaly as an effect of spectral flow of the energy levels, from the negative energy Dirac sea, across zero energy level in the presence of gauge interactions. This was extended to conformal anomaly in Ref. 23. In the present work, we exploit the latter formalism in black hole physics where we interpret crossing the horizon of black hole (the zero energy level) as a spectral flow since it is also accompanied by a change of sign in the energy of the particle. Furthermore, Hawking radiation induces a shrinking of the radius of the horizon(15,16) which reminds us of a similar rearrangement in the Fermi level generated by the spectral flow.(17,18,21) Hence in our formulation the negative energy states below horizon play a similar role as the Dirac sea. We successfully recover the gravitational anomaly.

AB We consider the quantum dynamics of a test particle in noncommutative space tinder the influence of linearized gravitational waves in the long wave-length and low-velocity limit. A prescription for quantizing the classical Hamiltonian for the interaction of gravitational wave with matter in noncommutative space is proposed. The Hamiltonian (and hence the system) is then exactly solved by using standard algebraic methods. The Solutions show prominent signatures of the noncommutative nature of space. Computation of the expectation value of the particle's position reveals the inherent quantum nature of spacetime noncommutativity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We study the quark deconfinement phase transition in hot beta-stable hadronic matter. Assuming a first order phase transition, we calculate the enthalpy per baryon of the hadron-quark phase transition. We calculate and compare the nucleation rate and the nucleation time due to thermal and quantum nucleation mechanisms. We compute the crossover temperature above which thermal nucleation dominates the finite temperature quantum nucleation mechanism. We next discuss the consequences for the physics of proto-neutron stars. We introduce the concept of limiting conversion temperature and critical mass M-cr for proto-hadronic stars, and we show that proto-hadronic stars with a mass M < M-cr could survive the early stages of their evolution without decaying to a quark star.

AB The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) reionization effort aims to map Out the largescale structure of the Universe during the epoch of reionization (EoR). Removal of polarized Galactic emission is a difficult part of any 21 cm EoR programme, and we present new upper limits to diffuse polarized foregroundsat 150 MHz. We find no high-significance evidence of polarized emission in our observed field at mid-galactic latitude (J2000 08(h)26(m)+26). Wefind an upper limit on the two-dimensional angular power spectrum of diffuse polarized foregrounds of (l(2)C(l)/2 pi)(1/2) < 3 K in frequency bins of width delta nu = 1 MHz at 300 < l < 1000.The three-dimensional power spectrum of polarized emission, which is most directly relevant to EoR observations, is [k(3)P(p)(k)/2 pi(2)](1/2) < 2 K at k(perpendicular to) > 0.03 h Mpc(-1), k < 0.1 h Mpc(-1). This can be compared to the expected EoR signal in total intensity of [k(3)P(k)/2 pi(2)](1/2) similar to 10 mK We find that polarized structure is substantially weaker than suggested by extrapolation from higher frequency observations, so the new low upper limits reported here reduce the anticipated impact of these foregrounds on EoR experiments. We discuss the Faraday beam and depth depolarization models and compare predictions of these models to our data. We report on a new technique for polarization calibration using pulsars, as well as a new technique to remove broad-band radio frequency interference. Our data indicate that, on the edges of the main beam at the GMRT, polarization squint Creates similar to 3 per cent leakage of unpolarized power into polarized maps Lit zero rotation measure. Ionospheric rotation was largely stable during these solar minimum nighttime observations.

AB The generation of mean magnetic fields is Studied for a simple non-helical flow where a net cross-helicity of either sign call emerge. This flow, which is also known as the Archontis flow, is a generalization of the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, but with the cosine terms omitted. The presence of cross-helicity leads to a mean-field dynamo effect that is known as the Yoshizawa effect. Direct numerical simulations of Such flows demonstrate the presence of magnetic fields oil scales larger than the scale of: the flow. Contrary to earlier expectations, the Yoshizawa effect is found to be proportional to the mean magnetic field and can therefore lead to its exponential instead Of just linear amplification for magnetic Reynolds numbers that exceed a certain critical Value. Unlike alpha effect dynamos, it is found that the Yoshizawa effect is not notably constrained by the presence of a conservation law. It is argued that this is due to the presence of a forcing term in the momentum equation, which leads to a non-zero correlation with the magnetic field. Finally, the application to energy convergence in solar wind turbulence is discussed.

AB We present near-infrared photospectroscopy in the H and K bands of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi. The observations cover the period between 1 and 94 d after the eruption. The near-infrared light curve is presented. An extensive set of spectra is presented, lines identified and the general characteristics of the spectra discussed. Analysis of the H I line profiles shows the presence of broad wings on both Hanks of a strong central component indicating the presence of a bipolar velocity flow in the ejecta. Such a flow is kinematically consistent with the bipolar structure that the object displays in high-resolution spatial images. We discuss the behaviour and origin of the Fe II lines at 1.6872 and 1.7414 mu m that are prominently seen throughout the span of the observations. It is examined and shown that Lyman alpha and Lyman continuum fluorescence are viable mechanisms to excite these lines. We draw upon the result, that collisional excitation call also contribute in exciting and significantly enhancing the strength of these Fe II lines, to propose that these lines originate from a site of high particle density. Such a likely site Could be the high-density, low-temperature contact surface that should exists in the shock front in between the shocked ejecta and red giant wind. Recombination analysis of the H I lines indicates deviations from case B conditions during most of the span Of our observations indicating optical depth effects. It appears likely that the breakout of the shock front had not yet Occurred till the end of our observations. An analysis is made of the temporal evolution of the [Si VI] 1.9641 mu m coronal line and another coronal line at 2.0894 mu m which is attributed to [Mn XIV]. Assuming collisional effects to dominate in the hot coronal gas, estimates are made of the ion temperature in the gas.

AB We consider the standard model extended by heavy right-handed fermions transforming as triplets under SU(2)(L), which generate neutrino masses through the Type-III seesaw mechanism. At energies below their respective mass scales, the heavy fields get sequentially decoupled to give an effective dimension-5 operator. Above their mass thresholds, these fields also participate in the renormalization of the wavefunctions, masses and coupling constants. We compute the renormalization group evolution of the effective neutrino mass matrix in this model, with particular emphasis on the threshold effects. The evolution equations are obtained in a basis of neutrino parameters where all the quantities are well-defined everywhere, including at theta(13) = 0. We also point out the important role of the threshold effects and Majorana phases in the evolution of mixing angles through illustrative examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A robust numerical method called the Preconditioned Bi-Conjugate Gradient (Pre-BiCG) method is proposed for the solution of the radiative transfer equation in spherical geometry. A variant of this method called Stabilized Preconditioned Bi-Conjugate Gradient (Pre-BiCG-STAB) is also presented. These are iterative methods based on the construction of a set of bi-orthogonal vectors. The application of the Pre-BiCG method in some benchmark tests shows that the method is quite versatile, and can handle difficult problems that may arise in astrophysical radiative transfer theory.

AB We report the discovery of supersonic downflows in a sunspot light bridge using measurements taken with the spectropolarimeter onboard the Hinode satellite. The downflows occur in small patches close to regions where the vector magnetic field changes orientation rapidly, and are associated with anomalous circular polarization profiles. An inversion of the observed Stokes spectra reveals velocities of up to 10 km s(-1), making them the strongest photospheric flows ever measured in light bridges. Some (but not all) of the downflowing patches are cospatial and cotemporal with brightness enhancements in chromospheric Ca II H filtergrams. We suggest that these flows are due to magnetic reconnection in the upper photosphere/lower chromosphere, although other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.

AB Soil texture is an important soil parameter that is useful for meteorology, climatology, hydrology, ecology, etc. Therefore, it is important to classify soil based on soil texture (i.e., sand, silt and clay). A lot of studies with radar remote sensing have been carried out to estimate soil moisture and surface roughness, but less attention has been given to study the effect of individual soil texture on radar scattering, especially in specular direction. The main aim of this paper is to check the behavior of specular scattering with change ill soil texture. This effect has also been analyzed in presence of soil moisture and surface roughness. Scattering coefficient has been retrieved for various soil texture fields with indigenously designed X-band bistatic scatterometer for a range of incidence angles (from 30 degrees to 70 degrees in steps of 10 degrees) in both like polarizations, i.e., HH-polarization and W-polarization. Observations were made at 10 GHz frequency. Four different fields were considered on the basis of soil texture variations; especially changes in sand percentage were made. Roughness (smooth soil to 1.4 cm rms surface height) and moisture (dry soil to 0.21 cm(3) cm(-3) volumetric soil moisture) conditions of these fields were varied for observations. Strong change in specular scattering coefficient is observed by changing the sand percentage in soil for HH-polarization, while in case of W-polarization a lesser change is observed. Also a high change in specular scattering coefficient is noticed once moisture is added to the soil. It is difficult to observe the change in specular scattering coefficient with change in soil texture when surface is considered as rough. Therefore, it is important to minimize the roughness effect while observing the texture with specular scattering. For this purpose, polarization study was carried out to see how polarization can be helpful to minimize the roughness effect. The effect of soil texture on copolarization ratio is critically analyzed, and it is observed that for higher incidence angle (>= 50 degrees), the distinction in soil texture fields are clearly observable oil the basis of copolarization ratio. This type of study will be helpful in near future to design the bistatic radar system for soil parameter monitoring, especially for cartwheel satellite system. (C) 2009 COSPAR.

AB Present study focuses on the estimation of rainfall over Indian land and oceanic regions from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F-13. Based on the measurements at 19.35, 22.235 and 85.5 GHz channels of SSM/I Satellite, scattering index (SI) has been developed for the Indian land and oceanic regions separately. These scattering indices were co-located against rainfall from Precipitation Radar (PR) onboard Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) to develop a new regional relationship between the SI and the rain rate for the Indian land and oceanic regions. A non-linear fit between the rain rate and the SI is established for rain measurement. In order to have confidence in our method, we have also estimated rainfall using the global rainfall and scattering index relationship developed by Ferraro and Marks [Ferraro, R.R., Marks, G.F. The development of SSMA rain rate retrieval algorithms using ground based radar measurements. J. Atmos. Ocean. Technol. 12, 755-770, 1995]. The validation with the rain-gauge shows that the present scheme is able to retrieve rainfall with better accuracy than that of Ferraro and Marks (1995). Further intercomparison with TRMM-2A12 and validation with rain-gauges rainfall showed that the present algorithm is able to retrieve the rainfall with reasonably good accuracy. (C) 2009 COSPAR.

AB Context. The CoRoT short runs give us the opportunity to observe a large variety of late-type stars through their solar-like oscillations. We report observations of the star HD 175726 that lasted for 27 days during the first short run of the mission. The time series reveals a high-activity signal and the power spectrum presents an excess due to solar-like oscillations with a low signal-to-noise ratio.
   Aims. Our aim is to identify the most efficient tools to extract as much information as possible from the power density spectrum.
   Methods. The most productive method appears to be the autocorrelation of the time series, calculated as the spectrum of the filtered spectrum. This method is efficient, very rapid computationally, and will be useful for the analysis of other targets, observed with CoRoT or with forthcoming missions such as Kepler and Plato.
   Results. The mean large separation has been measured to be 97.2 +/- 0.5 mu Hz, slightly below the expected value determined from solar scaling laws. We also show strong evidence for variation of the large separation with frequency. The bolometric mode amplitude is only 1.7 +/- 0.25 ppm for radial modes, which is 1.7 times less than expected. Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, mode identification is not possible for the available data set of HD 175726.

AB Context. The F8 star HD 181906 (effective temperature similar to 6300 K) was observed for 156 days by the CoRoT satellite during the first long run in the direction of the galactic centre. Analysis of the data reveals a spectrum of solar-like acoustic oscillations. However, the faintness of the target (m(v) = 7.65) means the signal-to-noise (S/N) in the acoustic modes is quite low, and this low S/N leads to complications in the analysis.
   Aims. We extract global variables of the star, as well as key parameters of the p modes observed in the power spectrum of the lightcurve.
   Methods. The power spectrum of the lightcurve, a wavelet transform and spot fitting were used to obtain the average rotation rate of the star and its inclination angle. Then, the autocorrelation of the power spectrum and the power spectrum of the power spectrum were used to properly determine the large separation. Finally, estimations of the mode parameters were done by maximizing the likelihood of a global fit, where several modes were fit simultaneously.
   Results. We have been able to infer the mean surface rotation rate of the star (similar to 4 mu Hz) with indications of the presence of surface differential rotation, the large separation of the p modes (similar to 87 mu Hz), hence also the "ridges" corresponding to overtones of the acoustic modes.

AB Context. The estimate of solar-like oscillation properties, such as their frequencies, amplitudes and lifetimes, is challenging because of their low amplitudes and will benefit from long and uninterrupted observing runs. The space telescope CoRoT allows us to obtain high-performance photometric data over a long and quasi continuous period. Among its main targets are stars for which we expect solar-like oscillations.
   Aims. HD 181420, an F2 main sequence star, has been observed by CoRoT during its first long run covering about 156 days. With this unprecedently high-quality set of data, our aim is to derive the p-mode parameters that can be used to probe the stellar interior.
   Methods. The CoRoT data obtained on HD 181420 is analysed using a classical Fourier approach for the search for the p mode signature. The p-mode parameters are then derived using global fitting of the power spectrum by a Lorentzian model, as used widely in the solar case.
   Results. From the p-mode frequencies, the mean value of the large spacing is estimated to be 75 mu Hz. The p-mode amplitudes are slightly less than 4 ppm with a line width of about 8 mu Hz at the maximum of the p modes. The inclination angle is estimated to be around 45 degrees. The large mode line-width combined with the observed mode spacing make it difficult to identify the l = 2 modes and to estimate the rotational splitting. We explore two scenarios for the identification of the modes.

AB Context. The nature of the galaxies that give rise to absorption lines, such as damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) or strong Mg II lines, in quasar spectra is diffcult to investigate in emission. These galaxies can be very faint and located close to the lines of sight of the much brighter background quasars.
   Aims. Taking advantage of the total absorption of the QSO light bluewards of the Lyman limit of two DLAs at z > 3.4, we look for the continuum emission from intervening galaxies at z approximate to 2 that are identified via strong metal absorption lines. The Mg II absorbers have equivalent width large enough to be potential DLA systems.
   Methods. Deep images are obtained with the FOcal Reducer and Spectrograph (FORS1) on the Very Large Telescope for the fields towards SDSS J110855+120953 and SDSS J140850+020522. These quasars have Mg II absorption lines at z = 1.87 (W-r(Mg II) = 2.46 angstrom) and z = 1.98 (W-r(Mg II) = 1.89 angstrom), respectively, and each QSO has two intervening higher redshift DLAs at z > 3. The U and R bands of FORS1 lie blue and redwards of the Lyman limit of the background DLAs, allowing us to search for emission from the foreground galaxies directly along the lines of sight to the QSOs.
   Results. No galaxies are found close to the sight line of the QSO to a point source limit of U-AB similar to 28.0. In both fields, the closest objects lie at an impact parameter of similar to 5 '' corresponding to similar to 40 kpc in projection at z = 2, and have typical colours of star forming galaxies at that redshift. However, the currently available data do not allow us to confirm if the galaxies lie at the same redshifts as the absorption systems. A more extended structure is visible in the SDSS J14085+020522 field at an impact parameter of 0 ''.8 or 7 kpc. If these objects are at z approximate to 2 their luminosities are 0.03-0.04 L* in both fields. The star formation rates estimated from the UV flux are 0.5-0.6 M-circle dot yr(-1), while the SFRs are half these values if the U band flux is due to Ly alpha emission alone.
   Conclusions. The non-detection of galaxies near to the line of sight is most likely explained by low metallicities and luminosities of the Mg II galaxies. Alternatively, the Mg II clouds are part of extended halos or in outflows from low-metallicity galaxies.

AB We present the results of a search for damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS), Data Release 7. We use a fully automatic procedure to identify DLAs and derive their column densities. The procedure is checked against the results of previous searches for DLAs in SDSS. We discuss the agreements and differences and show the robustness of our procedure. For each system, we obtain an accurate measurement of the absorber's redshift, the H I column density and the equivalent width of associated metal absorption lines, without any human intervention. We find 1426 absorbers with 2.15 < z < 5.2 with log N(H I) >= 20, out of which 937 systems have log N(H I) >= 20.3. This is the largest DLA sample ever built, made available to the scientific community through the electronic version of this paper.
   In the course of the survey, we discovered the intervening DLA with highest HI column density known to date with log N(H I) = 22.0 +/- 0.1. This single system provides a strong constraint on the high-end of the N(H I) frequency distribution now measured with high accuracy.
   We show that the presence of a DLA at the blue end of a QSO spectrum can lead to important systematic errors and propose a method to avoid them. This has important consequences for the measurement of the cosmological mass density of neutral gas at z similar to 2.2 and therefore on our understanding of galaxy evolution over the past 10 billion years.
   We find a significant decrease of the cosmological mass density of neutral gas in DLAs, Omega(DLA)(g), from z = 4 to z = 2.2, consistent with the result of previous SDSS studies. However, and contrary to other SDSS studies, we find that Omega(DLA)(g) (z = 2.2) is about twice the value at z = 0. This implies that Omega(DLA)(g) keeps decreasing at z < 2.2.

SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS

DE galaxies: active; quasars: general; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;

ID RADIO-SOURCES; RADIATION
AB We show that an upper limit of similar to 10(12) K on the peak brightness temperature for an incoherent synchrotron radio source, commonly referred to in the literature as an inverse Compton limit, really may not be due to inverse Compton effects. We show that a somewhat tighter limit T(eq) similar to 10(11) is actually obtained for the condition of equipartition of energy between radiating particles and magnetic fields, which happens to be a configuration of minimum energy for a self-absorbed synchrotron radio source. An order of magnitude change in brightness temperature from T(eq) in either direction would require departures from equipartition of about 8 orders of magnitude, implying a change in total energy of the system up to similar to 10(4) times the equipartition value. Constraints of such extreme energy variations imply that brightness temperatures may not depart much from T(eq). This is supported by the fact that at the spectral turnover, brightness temperatures much lower than similar to 10(11) K are also not seen in VLBI observations. Higher brightness temperatures in particular would require in the source not only many orders of magnitude higher additional energy for the relativistic particles but also many orders of magnitude weaker magnetic fields. Diamagnetic effects do not allow such extreme conditions, keeping the brightness temperatures close to the equipartition value, which is well below the limit where inverse Compton effects become important.

AB In this paper, we attempt to identify the driving forces responsible for the generation of low-latitude E-region field-aligned irregularities (FAIs). It is evident that the low-latitude E-region FAIs occur both during the day and night with preferential occurrence being most during local sunrise period. Simultaneous measurements are made with Gadanki radar and nearby located Ionosonde for understanding the low-latitude Es-FAIs relationship. The observations suggest that the occurrence and SNR of FAIs have a close relationship with f (t) E (s) --f (b) E (s) . Finally, using the past electron density profiles and reasonable values of electric field, we have shown that it is generally difficult with the gradient drift instability to explain low-latitude E-region FAIs when electric field alone is considered as driving agency. We hypothesize that neutral winds play important role for the generation of irregularities at low latitudes outside the electrojet belt either by forming sharp Es layers or by enhancing the differential drift of electrons and ions or by both.

AB Spatially homogeneous and anisotropic LRSBianchi type-I string cosmological models are studied in the frame work of general relativity when the source for the energy momentum tensor is a bulk viscous fluid containing one dimensional strings embedded in a magnetic field. A barotropic equation of state for the pressure and density is assumed to get determinate solutions of the field equations. The bulk viscous pressure is assumed to be proportional to the energy density. The effects of viscosity and electromagnetic field on the properties of the model are investigated. The role of bulk viscosity and electromagnetic field in getting an inflationary phase and in establishing a string phase in the universe is studied.

AB Presenting some interesting new solutions, rotating models of anisotropic two-fluid universes coupled with a magnetic field are investigated and studied, where the anisotropic pressure is generated by the presence of two non-interacting perfect fluids which are in relative motion with respect to each other. Here special discussion is made of the physically interesting class of models in which one fluid is a comoving radiative perfect fluid which is taken to model the cosmic microwave background and the second a non-comoving perfect fluid which will model the observed material content of the universe. Besides studying their physical and dynamical properties the effects of rotation on these models are studied and the reactions of the magnetic and gravitational fields with respect to the rotational motion are discussed. Analysis on the rotational perturbations are also made, in the course of which the amount of anisotropy induced in pressure distribution by a small deviation from the Friedmann metric is also investigated. The models obtained here are found to be theoretically satisfactory and thereby substantiates the possibilities of existence of such astrophysical objects in this Universe and may be taken as good examples of real astrophysical situations.

AB Exact solutions of the field equations for a Bianchi type-I space-time, filled with a viscous fluid and cosmological constant, are obtained. We utilize the constancy of deceleration parameter to get singular and non-singular solutions. We investigate a number of solutions with constant and time-varying cosmological constant together with a linear relation between shear viscosity and expansion scalar. Due to dissipative processes, the mean anisotropy and shear of the model tend to zero at a faster rate.

AB In this work, the Cosmic No-Hair Conjecture (CNHC) has been examined in the context of Randall-Sundrum type-II braneworld model. Instead of considering the usual anti-de Sitter bulk, a general form of the bulk matter has been taken into account. The effective Einstein equation on the brane has been derived. In order to obey the CNHC, some restrictions are obtained on the quadratic correction term as well as on the projected part of the bulk energy momentum tensor on the brane. It is found that for the validity of the conjecture on the brane, the bulk matter need not satisfy the standard energy conditions.

AB Scattering of oblique incident waves by small bottom undulation in a two-layer fluid, where the upper layer has a thin ice-cover while the lower one has the undulation, is investigated within the framework of linearized water wave theory. The ice-cover is being modeled as an elastic plate of very small thickness. There exist two modes of time-harmonic waves - one with lower wave number propagating along the ice-cover (ice-cover mode) and the other with higher wave number along the interface ( interfacial mode). A perturbation analysis is employed to solve the corresponding boundary value problem governed by modified Helmholtz equation and thereby evaluating the reflection and transmission coefficients approximately up to first order for both modes. A patch of sinusoidal ripples, having two different wave numbers over two consecutive stretches, is considered as an example and the related coefficients are determined. It is observed that when the wave is incident on the ice-cover surface we always find energy transfer to the interface, but for interfacial incident waves there are parameter ranges for which no energy transfer to the ice-cover surface is possible. Also it is observed that for small angles of incidence, the reflected energy is more as compared to the other angles of incidence. These results are demonstrated in graphical form. From the derived results, the solutions for problems with free surface can be obtained as particular cases.

AB We discuss spatially homogeneous and locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type V cosmological models under the influence of both bulk and shear viscosity coefficients with heat flow. Some exact solutions of the Einstein field equations are presented by using a law of variation for the generalized Hubble parameter that yields a constant value of the deceleration parameter. The law also generates power-law and exponential forms of the average scale factor in terms of the cosmic time t. To get a complete solution, a linear relation between the shear viscosity and the expansion scalar has been assumed. The presence of viscous terms, however, does not change the fundamental nature of the initial singularity. The solutions presented here satisfy all necessary conditions for physical acceptability. The thermodynamical relations, entropy production and energy condition in viscous fluid model are studied in detail.

AB The detection of individual ionized bubbles in H I 21-cm maps is one of the most promising, direct probes of the epoch of reionization (EoR). At least 1000 h of observation would be required for such a detection with either the currently functioning Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) or the upcoming Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). Considering the large investment for telescope time, it is essential to identify the 'optimal redshift' where the prospects of a detection are most favourable. We find that the optimal redshift is determined by a combination of instrument dependent factors and the evolution of the neutral fraction H-chi I. We find that the redshift range 8.1 +/- 1.1 and 9.8 +/- 1 are optimum for detecting ionized bubbles with the GMRT and MWA, respectively. The prospects of a detection, we find, are more favourable in a scenario with late reionization with H-chi I approximate to 0.5 at z approximate to 7.5 as compared to an early reionization model where H-chi I approximate to 0.5 at z approximate to 10. In the late reionization scenario, for both instruments a 3 sigma detection is possible for bubbles of comoving radius R-b >= 30 Mpc with 1000 h of observation. Future observations will either lead to the detection of ionized bubbles, or in the event of non-detection, lead to constraints on the product H-chi I R-b(gamma) for the observational volume, where gamma = 1.5 and 2 for GMRT and MWA, respectively.

AB We investigate the observational signatures associated with one of the proposed formation scenario for the recently discovered highly eccentric binary millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J1903+0327 in the galactic plane. The scenario requires that the MSP to be part of a hierarchical triple (HT), consisting of inner and outer binaries, experiencing the Kozai resonance. Numerical modelling of a bound point-mass HT, while incorporating the effects due to the quadrupolar interactions between the binary orbits and dominant contributions to the general relativistic periastron precession in the inner binary, reveals that, at the present epoch, the orbital eccentricity of the binary MSP should decrease for reasonable ranges in the HT parameters. The estimated decrements in the orbital eccentricity of the inner binary are few parts in 10(5), substantially higher than the reported accuracies in the estimation of the orbital eccentricity of the binary MSP, while employing various general relativistic timing models for isolated binary pulsars. For wide ranges in the allowed orbital parameters, the estimated rate of change in the eccentricity of the inner binary is orders of magnitude higher than the value recently measured by the pulsar timing analysis. Therefore, we rule out the scenario that the MSP is part of an HT undergoing the Kozai oscillations. The origin of this system in a typical globular cluster is also shown to be less likely than inferred in the discovery paper.

AB Striking examples of episodic activity in active galactic nuclei are the double-double radio galaxies (DDRGs)with two pairs of oppositely directed radio lobes from two different cycles of activity. Although there are over about a dozen good examples of DDRGs, so far no case of one associated with a quasar has been reported. We present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations of a candidate double-double radio quasar, J0935+0204 (4C 02.27), and suggest that radio jets in this source may also have been intrinsically asymmetric, contributing to the large observed asymmetries in the flux density and location of both pairs of radio lobes.

AB The assumption that the Universe, on sufficiently large scales, is homogeneous and isotropic is crucial to our current understanding of cosmology. In this Letter, we test if the observed galaxy distribution is actually homogeneous on large scales. We have carried out a multifractal analysis of the galaxy distribution in a volume-limited subsample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 6. This considers the scaling properties of different moments of galaxy number counts in spheres of varying radius, r, centred on galaxies. This analysis gives the spectrum of generalized dimension D(q)(r), where q > 0 quantifies the scaling properties in overdense regions and q < 0 in underdense regions. We expect D(q)(r) = 3 for a homogeneous, random point distribution. In our analysis, we have determined D(q)(r) in the range -4 <= q <= 4 and 7 <= r <= 98 h(-1) Mpc. In addition to the SDSS data, we have analysed several random samples which are homogeneous by construction. Simulated galaxy samples generated from dark matter N-body simulations and the Millennium Run were also analysed. The SDSS data is considered to be homogeneous if the measured D(q) is consistent with that of the random samples. We find that the galaxy distribution becomes homogeneous at a length-scale between 60 and 70 h(-1) Mpc. The galaxy distribution, we find, is homogeneous at length-scales greater than 70 h(-1) Mpc. This is consistent with earlier works which find the transition to homogeneity at around 70 h(-1) Mpc.

AB We present a semi-analytical model of star formation which explains simultaneously the observed ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) of high-redshift Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and LFs of Lyman alpha emitters. We consider both models that use the Press-Schechter (PS) and Sheth-Tormen (ST) halo mass functions to calculate the abundances of dark matter haloes. The Lyman alpha LFs at z less than or similar to 4 are well reproduced with only less than or similar to 10 per cent of the LBGs emitting Lyman alpha lines with rest equivalent width greater than the limiting equivalent width of the narrow band surveys. However, the observed LF at z > 5 can be reproduced only when we assume that nearly all LBGs are Lyman alpha emitters. Thus, it appears that 4 < z < 5 marks the epoch when a clear change occurs in the physical properties of the high-redshift galaxies. As Lyman alpha escape depends on dust and gas kinematics of the interstellar medium (ISM), this could mean that on an average the ISM at z > 5 could be less dusty, more clumpy and having more complex velocity field. All of these will enable easier escape of the Lyman alpha photons. At z > 5, the observed Lyman alpha LF are well reproduced with the evolution in the halo mass function along with very minor evolution in the physical properties of high-redshift galaxies. In particular, up to z = 6.5, we do not see the effect of evolving intergalactic medium opacity on the Lyman alpha escape from these galaxies.

AB The form of the halo mass function is a basic ingredient in any semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We study the existing forms of the mass functions in the literature and compare their predictions for semi-analytical galaxy formation models. Two methods are used in the literature to compute the net formation rate of halos, one by simply taking the derivative of the halo mass function and the other using the prescription due to Sasaki [Sasaki, S., 1994. PASJ 46, 427]. For the historically used Press-Schechter (PS) mass function, we compare various model predictions, using these two methods. However, as the Sasaki formalism cannot be easily generalized for other mass functions, we use the derivative while comparing model predictions of different mass functions. We show that the reionization history and UV luminosity function of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) predicted by the PS mass function differs from those using any other existing mass function, like Sheth-Tormen (ST) mass function. In particular the reionization efficiency of molecular cooled halos has to be substantially reduced when one uses the ST and other mass functions obtained from the simulation instead of the PS mass function. Using chi(2)-minimization, we find that the observed UV luminosity functions of LBGs at 3.0 <= z <= 7.4 are better reproduced by models using the ST mass function compared to models that use the PS mass function. On the other hand, the volume filling factor of the metals expelled from the galaxies through supernovae driven outflows differs very little between models with different mass functions. It depends on the way we treat merging outflows. We also show that the porosity weighted average quantities related to the outflow are not very sensitive to the differences in the halo mass function.

AB We studied a left-right symmetric model that can accommodate the neutrino dark energy (nu DE) proposal. The type-III seesaw mechanism is implemented to give masses to the neutrinos. After explaining the model, we study the consistency of the model by minimizing the scalar potential and obtaining the conditions for the required vacuum expectation values of the different scalar fields. This model is then embedded in an SO(10) grand unified theory and the allowed symmetry breaking scales are determined by the condition of the gauge coupling unification. Although SU(2)(R) breaking is required to be high, its Abelian subgroup U(1)(R) is broken in the TeV range, which can then give the required neutrino masses and predicts new gauge bosons that could be detected at LHC. The neutrino masses are studied in detail in this model, which shows that at least 3 singlet fermions are required.

AB Marginal Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models with corrections from loop quantum gravity have recently been studied with an emphasis on potential singularity resolution. This paper corroborates and extends the analysis in two regards: (i) the whole class of LTB models, including nonmarginal ones, is considered, and (ii) an alternative procedure to derive anomaly-free models is presented which first implements anomaly freedom in spherical symmetry and then the LTB conditions rather than the other way around. While the two methods give slightly different equations of motion, not altogether surprisingly given the ubiquitous sprawl of quantization ambiguities, final conclusions remain unchanged: compared to quantizations of homogeneous models, bounces seem to appear less easily in inhomogeneous situations, and even the existence of homogeneous solutions as special cases in inhomogeneous models may be precluded by quantum effects. However, compared to marginal models, bouncing solutions seem more likely with nonmarginal models.

AB The two-body dynamics in general relativity has been solved perturbatively using the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation. The evolution of the orbital phase and the emitted gravitational radiation are now known to a rather high order up to O(v(8)), v being the characteristic velocity of the binary. The orbital evolution, however, cannot be specified uniquely due to the inherent freedom in the choice of parameter used in the PN expansion, as well as the method pursued in solving the relevant differential equations. The goal of this paper is to determine the (dis)agreement between different PN waveform families in the context of initial and advanced gravitational-wave detectors. The waveforms employed in our analysis are those that are currently used by Initial LIGO/Virgo, that is, the time-domain PN models TaylorT1, TaylorT2, TaylorT3, the Fourier-domain representation TaylorF2 (or stationary phase approximant), and the effective-one-body model, and two more recent models, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt. For these models we examine their overlaps with one another for a number of different binaries at 2PN, 3PN, and 3.5PN orders to quantify their differences. We then study the overlaps of these families with the prototype effective-one-body family, currently used by Initial LIGO, calibrated to numerical-relativity simulations to help us decide whether there exist preferred families, in terms of detectability and computational cost, that are the most appropriate as search templates. We conclude that as long as the total mass remains less than a certain upper limit M-crit, all template families at 3.5PN order (except TaylorT3 and TaylorEt) are equally good for the purpose of detection. The value of M-crit is found to be similar to 12M(circle dot) for Initial, Enhanced, and Advanced LIGO. From a purely computational point of view, we recommend that 3.5PN TaylorF2 be used below M-crit and that the effective-one-body model calibrated to numerical-relativity simulations be used for total binary mass M > M-crit.

AB The relativistic spinning particle model, proposed in [S. M. Kuzenko, S. L. Lyakhovich, and A. Y. Segal, Int. J. Mod. Phys. A 10, 1529 (1995); A. Staruszkiewicz, Acta Phys. Pol. A 1, 109 (2008).] is analyzed in a Hamiltonian framework. The spin is simulated by extending the configuration space by introducing a lightlike four vector degree of freedom. The model is heavily constrained and constraint analysis, in the Dirac scheme, is both novel and instructive. Our major finding is an associated novel noncommutative structure in the extended space. This is obtained in a particular gauge. The model possesses a large gauge freedom and hence a judicious choice of gauge becomes imperative. The gauge fixed system in reduced phase space simplifies considerably for further study. We have shown that this noncommutative phase space algebra is essential in revealing the spin effects in the particle model through the Lorentz generator and Hamiltonian equations of motion.

AB Dark and baryonic matter contribute comparable energy density to the present universe. The dark matter may also be responsible for the cosmic positron and electron excesses. We connect these phenomena with the Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses. In our model (i) the dark matter relic density is a dark matter asymmetry generated simultaneously with the baryon asymmetry so that we can naturally understand the coincidence between the dark and baryonic matter and (ii) the dark matter mostly decays into the leptons so that its decay can interpret the anomalous cosmic rays with positron and electron excesses.

AB Mach's principle is the proposition that inertial frames are determined by matter. We put forth and implement a precise correspondence between matter and geometry that realizes Mach's principle. Einstein's equations are not modified and no selection principle is applied to their solutions; Mach's principle is realized wholly within Einstein's general theory of relativity. The key insight is the observation that, in addition to bulk matter, one can also add boundary matter. Given a space-time, and thus the inertial frames, we can read off both boundary and bulk stress tensors, thereby relating matter and geometry. We consider some global conditions that are necessary for the space-time to be reconstructible, in principle, from bulk and boundary matter. Our framework is similar to that of the black hole membrane paradigm and, in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-times, is consistent with holographic duality.

AB We study the growth of matter density perturbations delta(m) for a number of viable f(R) gravity models that satisfy both cosmological and local gravity constraints, where the Lagrangian density f is a function of the Ricci scalar R. If the parameter m  Rf,(RR)/f,(R) today is larger than the order of 10(-6), linear perturbations relevant to the matter power spectrum evolve with a growth rate s  d ln delta m/d lna (a is the scale factor) that is larger than in the Lambda CDM model. We find the window in the free parameter space of our models for which spatial dispersion of the growth index gamma 0  gamma(z = 0) ( z is the redshift) appears in the range of values 0.40 less than or similar to gamma(0) less than or similar to 0.55, as well as the region in parameter space for which there is essentially no dispersion and gamma(0) converges to values around 0.40 less than or similar to gamma(0) less than or similar to 0.43. These latter values are much lower than in the Lambda CDM model. We show that these unusual dispersed or converged spectra are present in most of the viable f(R) models with m (z = 0) larger than the order of 10(-6). These properties will be essential in the quest for f(R) modified gravity models using future high-precision observations and they confirm the possibility to distinguish clearly most of these models from the Lambda CDM model.

AB We have investigated the role of group velocity in the calculation of pitch-angle diffusion coefficients by electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves in planetary magnetospheres. The assumption which is generally made that the parallel group velocity can be neglected in comparison with particle parallel velocity is examined in detail. It is found that for lowest harmonic band this assumption is quite good. It is found that in general it is not possible to ignore the parallel group velocity. However, for lowest harmonic band this assumption is quite good at low electron temperatures. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Lunar mare basalts, highland anorthosites and KREEP are the three major lunar rock types reported from the lunar surface. In the present study, we interpret the reflectance spectral behavior of lunar analog basalts including massive basalt, vesicular basalt and amygdaloidal basalt collected from the Deccan basaltic region, which are considered as equivalent of lunar mare basalts. Reflectance spectra of analog basalts were measured at three different environments: in the field, under controlled field conditions and in the lab. in field conditions the reflectance spectra were measured under 350-1050 nm spectral range. During controlled field and lab condition, reflectance spectra were measured under 350-2500 nm range covering the UV, visible, NIR, and SWIR regions. The spectral characteristics of basalts measured under different environments and their merits and demerits were discussed. However, lab spectra have given clear, reliable diagnostic spectral information for our present objective. The major oxides and minerals of analog basalts were compared with lunar mare basalts. The presence of Ca-pyroxene, ferrous and ferric iron and their diagnostic spectral features in basalts are discussed for study of lunar mare region. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI TELICS-A Telescope Instrument Control System for Small/Medium Sized

SO PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC
LA English
DT Article
AB For any modern astronomical observatory, it is essential to have an efficient interface between the telescope and its back-end instruments. However, for small and medium-sized observatories, this requirement is often limited by tight financial constraints. Therefore a simple yet versatile and low-cost control system is required for such observatories to minimize cost and effort. Here we report the development of a modern, multipurpose instrument control system TELICS (Telescope Instrument Control System) to integrate the controls of various instruments and devices mounted on the telescope. TELICS consists of an embedded hardware unit known as a common control unit (CCU) in combination with Linux-based data acquisition and user interface. The hardware of the CCU is built around the ATmega 128 microcontroller (Atmel Corp.) and is designed with a backplane, master-slave architecture. A Qt-based graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed and the back-end application software is based on C/C++. TELICS provides feedback mechanisms that give the operator good visibility and a quick-look display of the status and modes of instruments as well as data. TELICS has been used for regular science observations since 2008 March on the 2 m, f/10 IUCAA Telescope located at Girawali in Pune, India.

AB The study of W UMa binary systems gives a wealth of information about their nature as well as their parent bodies (if any), like clusters. In this paper, we present the I passband photometric solutions of four W UMa binaries in the open cluster Berkeley 39 using the latest version of the W-D program. The result shows that two binary systems are W-subtype W UMa binary systems and the other two systems are H-subtype W UMa binary systems. No third body has been found in any of the four systems. We found a correlation between the period and mass-ratio as well as temperature and mass-ratio for the respective variables, which is similar to the relationship between mass ratio and total mass of the contact binaries as shown by van't Veer and Li et al.

TI 3D Evolution of a Filament Disappearance Event Observed by STEREO
SO SOLAR PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Filament disappearance; STEREO; CME; Plasma
AB A filament disappearance event was observed on 22 May 2008 during our recent campaign JOP 178. The filament, situated in the Southern Hemisphere, showed sinistral chirality consistent with the hemispheric rule. The event was well observed by several observatories, in particular by THEMIS. One day, before the disappearance, H alpha observations showed up- and down-flows in adjacent locations along the filament, which suggest plasma motions along twisted flux rope. THEMIS and GONG observations show shearing photospheric motions leading to magnetic flux canceling around barbs. STEREO A, B spacecraft with separation angle 52.4A degrees, showed quite different views of this untwisting flux rope in He ii 304 images. Here, we reconstruct the three-dimensional geometry of the filament during its eruption phase using STEREO EUV He ii 304 images and find that the filament was highly inclined to the solar normal. The He ii 304 movies show individual threads, which oscillate and rise to an altitude of about 120 Mm with apparent velocities of about 100 km s(-1) during the rapid evolution phase. Finally, as the flux rope expands into the corona, the filament disappears by becoming optically thin to undetectable levels. No CME was detected by STEREO, only a faint CME was recorded by LASCO at the beginning of the disappearance phase at 02:00 UT, which could be due to partial filament eruption. Further, STEREO Fe xii 195 images showed bright loops beneath the filament prior to the disappearance phase, suggesting magnetic reconnection below the flux rope.

AB We have reconstructed the leading edge of a coronal mass ejection (CME) observed on 20 May 2007 by COR1 and COR2 of the SECCHI suite onboard the twin STEREO spacecraft. The reconstruction of the leading edge of this CME was achieved using the tie-pointing method based on epipolar geometry. The true speeds derived from the reconstruction of the leading edge were estimated. These estimated true speeds were compared with the projected plane-of-sky speeds of the leading edge of the CME derived from LASCO aboard SoHO as well as from STEREO A and B images individually. The results show that a better estimation of the true speed of the CME in the Sun -aEuro parts per thousand Earth direction is achieved from the 3D reconstruction and therefore has an important bearing on space weather prediction.

AB Electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) have been observed in the Earth's magnetosheath region by Cluster. A mechanism for the generation of these structures in terms of electron-acoustic solitons and double layers is discussed. The model simulates the magnetosheath plasma by a four-component plasma system consisting of core electrons, two counterstreaming electron beams, and one type of ions. The analysis is based on the fluid equations and the Poisson equation, and employs the Sagdeev pseudopotential techniques to investigate the solitary waves. The electric field amplitudes, the time durations, and the propagation speeds of the solitary structures predicted by the model are in good agreement with the observed electric fields, pulse widths, and speeds of the electrostatic bipolar pulses.

AB A model for the pd -> pd eta reaction published earlier, including the final state interaction (FSI) of all particles, is revisited to investigate the low energy data on this reaction. The three-body problem of p-d-eta scattering in the final state is approximated in terms of pairwise interactions between the three particles in the final state. A part from a comparison with some preliminary data, two new findings relevant to the near threshold data analysis are reported. The first one points toward the limitations of an FSI factor used conventionally to extract the eta-deuteron scattering length and infer subsequently on the existence of eta-mesicstates. The second result emphasizes the role of the p-d FSI and the strong Coulomb repulsion near threshold. Finally, a comparison of the above model calculation with low energy data, excludes very large eta-nucleon scattering lengths.

In principle, all thermal variables can be expressed as functions of either volume or temperature. A new equation of state for MCG is obtained during thermal process. The asymptotic analysis shows that the thermal evolution of the universe is possible from radiation era to ACDM model, i.e. the thermal history of MCG gives a unified picture of dark matter and dark energy and as a result the universe cools down through expansion without any phase transition (no critical point).

AB We present the results obtained by a detailed study of the extragalactic Z source LMC X-2, using broad-band Suzaku data and a large (similar to 750 ks) data set obtained with the proportional counter array (PCA) onboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Experiment (RXTE). The PCA data allow the study of the complete spectral evolution along the horizontal, normal and flaring branches of the Z track. Comparison with previous studies shows that the details of spectral evolution (like the variation of Comptonizing electron temperature) are similar to those of GX 17+2 but unlike those of Cyg X-2 and GX 349+2. This suggests that Z sources are a heterogeneous group, with perhaps LMC X-2 and GX 17+2 being members of a subclass. However, non-monotonic evolution of the Compton y parameter seems to be generic to all sources. The broad-band Suzaku data reveal that the case in which the additional soft component of the source is modelled as disc blackbody emission is strongly preferred over the one where it is taken to be a blackbody spectrum. This component, as well as the temperature of seed photons, does not vary when the source goes into flaring mode, and the entire variation can be ascribed to the Comptonizing cloud. The bolometric unabsorbed luminosity of the source is constrained to be similar to 2.23 x 10(38) erg s(-1), which, if the source is Eddington-limited, implies a neutron star mass of 1.6 M-circle dot. We discuss the implications of these results.

AB Using mean-field models with a dynamical quenching formalism, we show that in finite domains magnetic helicity fluxes associated with small-scale magnetic fields are able to alleviate catastrophic quenching. We consider fluxes that result from advection by a mean flow, the turbulent mixing down the gradient of mean small-scale magnetic helicity density or the explicit removal which may be associated with the effects of coronal mass ejections in the Sun. In the absence of shear, all the small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes are found to be equally strong for both large-and small-scale fields. In the presence of shear, there is also an additional magnetic helicity flux associated with the mean field, but this flux does not alleviate catastrophic quenching. Outside the dynamo-active region, there are neither sources nor sinks of magnetic helicity, so in a steady state this flux must be constant. It is shown that unphysical behaviour emerges if the small-scale magnetic helicity flux is forced to vanish within the computational domain.

AB PSR B0818-41 is one of the few pulsars that show multiple drift regions having well-defined phase relationship. In this paper, we report new results from multifrequency observations of this pulsar with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). We determine the mean flux of the pulsar at multiple frequencies and find evidence for a low frequency turnover in its spectrum. Significant linear polarization is observed with depolarization at the edge of the profile, which is likely to be due to orthogonal polarization mode jumps. Circular polarization changes sign near the middle of the pulse profile at 1060 MHz, which is not observed at 325 and 610 MHz. A remarkable frequency evolution of polarization angle (PA) is observed for this pulsar, which is commonly not seen in other pulsars. Based on the frequency evolution of average profile, the observed PA swing and the results from subpulse drifting, we propose two possible emission geometries, alpha similar to 11 degrees, beta similar to -5 degrees.4 and alpha similar to 175 degrees.4, beta similar to -6 degrees.9, and compare those in detail with observed properties. In addition to the remarkable subpulse drifting observed at 325 MHz, we report subpulse drifting at 244 and 610 MHz. At 244 MHz we observe drifting in the outer regions but not in the inner region, whereas at 610 MHz subpulse drift is observed in both inner and outer regions. Sometimes, we see changes of apparent drift rates, transitions from negative to stationary (phase stationary intensity modulation) and stationary to negative drift rates, many of which appear to have some connection with nulls. We determine P(3)(m) (the measured time interval between the recurrence of successive drift bands at a given pulse longitude), P(2)(m) (the measured longitude separation between two adjacent drift bands) and Delta Phi (subpulse width) values at different frequencies for both inner and outer drift regions. Although P(3)(m) is the same for all the drift regions, P(2)(m) and Delta Phi values are different. The peak emission from the leading and the trailing outer regions is offset by similar to 9P(1). Utilizing this information, we solve the aliasing problem and argue that drifting is first-order aliased with corresponding carousel rotation period P(4) similar to 10 s, which makes it the fastest known carousel. The drift pattern from the two rings is phase locked for PSR B0818-41. The same is found to be true for all pulsars showing drifting in multiple rings of emission. This finding puts constraints on the theoretical models of pulsar emission mechanism, and favours a pan magnetospheric radiation mechanism.

AB We construct the intersecting non-supersymmetric (non-susy) D1/D5 solution of type IIB string theory. While, as usual, the solution is charged under an electric two-form and an electric six-form gauge field, it also contains a non-susy chargeless (non-BPS) DO-brane. The S-dual of this solution is the non-susy F/NS5 solution. We show how these solutions nicely interpolate between the corresponding black (or non-extremal) solutions and the Kaluza-Klein (KK) "bubble of nothing" (BON) by continuously changing some parameters characterizing the solutions from one set of values to another. We show, by a time symmetric general bubble initial data analysis, that the final bubbles in these cases are static and stable and the interpolations can be physically interpreted as closed string tachyon condensation. As special cases, we recover the transition of two charge black F-string to BON, considered by Horowitz, and also the transition from AdS(3) black hole to global AdS(3).

AB Results from high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of HD77361 are reported. LTE analysis shows that HD77361 is a K giant of atmospheric parameters: T-eff = 4580 +/- 75 K, log g = 2.5 +/- 0.1, and xi(t) = 1.40 +/- 0.5 km s(-1). We found that the atmosphere of HD 77361 is highly enriched in Li with log epsilon (Li) = 3.82 +/- 0.1. With this finding the total number of super Li-rich K giants (log epsilon(Li) >= 3.3 ISM value) known to date reached six. Contrary to first dredge-up, extra-deep mixing and the associated cool bottom processing, and other recent predictions for K giants on the red giant branch (RGB) luminosity bump phase, HD 77361 shows a very low value of C-12/C-13 = 4.3 +/- 0.5, having, simultaneously, very large amount of Li. Also, HD 77361 is the only Population I low-luminosity (log L/L-circle dot = 1.66 +/- 0.1) low-mass K giant (M = 1.5 +/- 0.2 M-circle dot) among the known super Li-rich K giants that has a very low C-12/C-13 ratio. Results of HD 77361 further constrain our theoretical understanding of Li enhancement in the atmospheres of RGB stars.

AB The bar of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is one of the prominent, but controversial, features regarding its location with respect to the disk of the LMC. In order to study the relative location of the bar with respect to the disk, we present the high-resolution map of the structure across the LMC. We used the reddening corrected mean magnitudes (I-0) of red clump (RC) stars from the OGLE III catalog to map the relative variation in distance (vertical structure) or variation in RC population across the LMC. The bar does not appear as an identifiable vertical feature in the map, as there is no difference in I-0 values between the bar and the disk regions. We conclude that the LMC bar is very much part of the disk (within 0.02 mag), located in the plane of the disk and not a separate component. We identify warps or variation in RC population with increase in radial distance.

AB In a novel approach to studying viscous accretion flows, viscosity has been introduced as a perturbative effect, involving a first-order correction in the alpha-viscosity parameter. This method reduces the problem of solving a second-order non-linear differential equation (Navier-Stokes equation) to that of an effective first-order equation. Viscosity breaks down the invariance of the equilibrium conditions for stationary inflow and outflow solutions, and distinguishes accretion from wind. Under a dynamical systems classification, the only feasible critical points of this 'quasi-viscous' flow are saddle points and spirals. On large spatial scales of the disc, where a linearized and radially propagating time-dependent perturbation is known to cause a secular instability, the velocity evolution equation of the quasi-viscous flow has been transformed to bear a formal closeness with Schrodinger's equation with a repulsive potential. Compatible with the transport of angular momentum to the outer regions of the disc, a viscosity-limited length-scale has been defined for the full spatial extent over which the accretion process would be viable.

We also show that in the case of GMRT, T(erc) varies mainly with elevation and ambient temperature. The calibration techniques evolved here are applicable to similar interferometers with a large number of antennas, several frequency bands and a number of receiver systems at room temperature (where conventional methods are time-consuming). This method ideally requires just one complete day of observations in a frequency band.

AB We estimate the power spectrum of H i intensity fluctuations for a sample of eight galaxies (seven dwarf and one spiral). The power spectrum can be fitted to a power-law for six of these galaxies, indicating turbulence is operational. The estimated best-fitting value for the slope ranges from similar to -1.5 (AND IV, NGC 628, UGC 4459 and GR 8) to similar to -2.6 (DDO 210 and NGC 3741). We interpret this bi-modality as being due to having effectively 2D turbulence on length-scales much larger than the scale-height of the galaxy disc and 3D otherwise. This allows us to use the estimated slope to set bounds on the scale-heights of the face-on galaxies in our sample. We also find that the power-law slope remains constant as we increase the channel thickness for all these galaxies, suggesting that the fluctuations in H i intensity are due to density fluctuations and not velocity fluctuations, or that the slope of the velocity structure function is similar to 0. Finally, for the four galaxies with '2D turbulence' we find that the slope alpha correlates with the star formation rate (SFR) per unit area, with larger SFRs leading to steeper power laws. Given our small sample size, this result needs to be confirmed with a larger sample.

The survey covered 106 deg(2) with a sensitivity of roughly 1 mJy to long-period pulsars (pulsars with period longer than 1 s). The three new pulsars have periods of 318, 933 and 1056 ms. Their timing parameters and flux densities, obtained in follow-up observations with the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank and the GMRT, are presented. We also report on pulse nulling behaviour in one of the newly discovered pulsars, PSR J2208+5500.

AB We examine the case for quark-novae (QNe) as possible sources for the reionization and early metal enrichment of the universe. QNe are predicted to arise from the explosive collapse (and conversion) of sufficiently massive neutron stars into quark stars (QSs). A QN can occur over a range of timescales following the supernova (SN) event. For QNe that arise days to weeks after the SNe, we show that dual shock that arises as the QN ejecta encounter the SN ejecta can produce enough photons to reionize hydrogen in most of the intergalactic medium (IGM) by z similar to 6. Such events can explain the large optical depth tau(e) similar to 0.1 as measured by WMAP, if the clumping factor, C, of the material being ionized is smaller than 10. We suggest a way in which a normal initial mass function for the oldest stars can be reconciled with a large optical depth as well as the mean metallicity of the early IGM post reionization. We find that QN also make a contribution to r-process element abundances for atomic numbers A >= 130. We predict that the main cosmological signatures of QNe are the gamma-ray bursts that announce their birth. These will be clustered at redshifts in the range z similar to 7-8 in our model.

AB The presence of fine structures in sunspot vector magnetic fields has been confirmed from Hinode as well as other earlier observations. We studied 43 sunspots based on the data sets taken from ASP/DLSP, Hinode (SOT/SP), and SVM (USO). In this Letter, (1) we introduce the concept of signed shear angle (SSA) for sunspots and establish its importance for non-force-free fields. (2) We find that the sign of global alpha (force-free parameter) is well correlated with that of the global SSA and the photospheric chirality of sunspots. (3) Local alpha patches of opposite signs are present in the umbra of each sunspot. The amplitude of the spatial variation of local alpha in the umbra is typically of the order of the global alpha of the sunspot. (4) We find that the local alpha is distributed as alternately positive and negative filaments in the penumbra. The amplitude of azimuthal variation of the local alpha in the penumbra is approximately an order of magnitude larger than that in the umbra. The contributions of the local positive and negative currents and alpha in the penumbra cancel each other giving almost no contribution for their global values for the whole sunspot. (5) Arc-like structures (partial rings) with a sign opposite to that of the dominant sign of alpha of the umbral region are seen at the umbral-penumbral boundaries of some sunspots. (6) Most of the sunspots studied belong to the minimum epoch of the 23rd solar cycle and do not follow the so-called hemispheric helicity rule.

TI Stable homology as an indicator of manifoldlikeness in causal set theory
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
LA English
DT Article
ID TOPOLOGY; SPACETIME; GRAVITY
AB We present a computational tool that can be used to obtain the 'spatial' homology groups of a causal set. Localization in the causal set is seeded by an inextendible antichain, which is the analogue of a spacelike hypersurface, and a one-parameter family of nerve simplicial complexes is constructed by 'thickening' this antichain. The associated homology groups can then be calculated using existing homology software, and their behaviour studied as a function of the thickening parameter. Earlier analytical work showed that for an inextendible antichain in a causal set which can be approximated by a globally hyperbolic spacetime region, there is a one-parameter sub-family of these simplicial complexes which are homological to the continuum, provided the antichain satisfies certain conditions. Using causal sets that are approximated by a set of 2D spacetimes, our numerical analysis suggests that these conditions are generically satisfied by inextendible antichains. In both 2D and 3D simulations, as the thickening parameter is increased, the continuum homology groups tend to appear as the first region in which the homology is constant, or 'stable', above the discreteness scale. Below this scale, the homology groups fluctuate rapidly as a function of the thickening parameter. This provides a necessary though not sufficient criterion to test for manifoldlikeness of a causal set.

Self-adjoint extensions (SAE) is responsible for introducing this scale in quantum mechanical models through the nontrivial boundary conditions. We discuss a couple of classically scale invariant free particle systems to illustrate the issue. In this context it has been shown that a free quantum particle moving on a full line may have localized wave-packet around the origin. As a generalization, it has also been shown that particles moving on a portion of a plane or on a portion of a three-dimensional space can have unusual localized wave-packet

AB Context. We present observations of the GRB 080319B afterglow at optical, mm, and radio frequencies between a few hours and 67 days after the burst.
   Aims. We attempt to understand the nature of this extraordinarily bright explosion based on the observed properties and its comparison with afterglow models.
   Methods. Our observations and other published multiwavelength data were used to reconstruct the light curves and spectral energy distributions of the burst afterglow.
   Results. Our results indicate that the observed features of the afterglow agrees equally well with the inter stellar matter and the stellar wind density profiles of the circumburst medium. In the case of both density profiles, the maximum synchrotron frequency nu(m) is below optical value and the cooling break frequency nu(c) is below X-rays, similar to 10(4) s after the burst. The derived value of the Lorentz factor at the time of naked-eye brightness is also similar to 300 for a corresponding blast-wave size of similar to 10(18) cm.
   Conclusions. The numerical fit to the multiwavelength afterglow data constraints the values of physical parameters and the emission mechanism of the burst.

AB Context. It has long been suggested that shocks might play an important role in altering the form of the interstellar medium (ISM). Shocks enhance gas density and sufficiently dense regions may become self gravitating. Potential star-forming clouds within larger molecular clouds, move randomly at supersonic speeds and a collision between them, is highly inelastic.
   Aims. Depending on the precollision velocity, colliding molecular clouds produce a slab that is either shock-compressed or pressure-confined. In a sequel of two Papers (I and II), we simulate molecular cloud collision and investigate the dynamical evolution of such slabs. Shocked slabs appear susceptible to hydrodynamic instabilities and, in the present Paper (I), we study the effect of strong shear between slab layers on the dynamic evolution of a shock compressed gas slab. Head-on and off-centre cloud collisions have been examined in this work. Self gravity is included in all our simulations.
   Methods. Simulations presented were performed using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical scheme. Individual, precollision clouds are modelled as pressure-confined Bonnor-Ebert spheres. However, for simplicity the thermodynamic details of the problem are simplified and the gas temperature is evolved simply by a barytropic equation of state. Obviously, the gas suffers to some extent from thermal inertial effects. However, we note that the dynamical timescale is much smaller than the local sound crossing time so that any such effects should have minimum influence.
   Results. Strong shocks are highly radiative. Thus a highly supersonic cloud collision produces a cold, roughly isothermal shock compressed gas slab. We find that the shocked slab is susceptible to dynamical instabilities like the gravitational instability, Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability and the non linear thin shell instability (NTSI). Rapid growth of instabilities within the slab produces structure in it. The NTSI competes with the gravitational instability and the fate of the shocked slab apparently depends on the relative dominance of either of the two instabilities. Dominance of the NTSI causes turbulent mixing between slab layers and dissipates internal energy. Eventually the slab collapses to form a thin elongated body, aligned with the collision axis, and star formation may commence in it. Our hydrodynamical models discussed here suggest that, high-velocity cloud collisions may be a viable mechanism for the formation of observed filamentary structure in the ISM.

AB Aims. In this second paper of the sequel of two papers, we continue to investigate the problem of molecular cloud (MC) collision. The companion paper to this one considered highly supersonic cloud collisions and examined the effect of bending and shearing instabilities on the shocked gas slab. We now consider moderately supersonic cloud collisions (precollision cloud velocities from 1.2 km s(-1) to 2.4 km s(-1)).
   Methods. In the current paper, we present five SPH simulations of fast head-on and/or off-centre cloud collisions to study the evolution of a ram-pressure confined gas slab. The relevant thermodynamical details of the problem have been simplified by adopting a simple barytropic equation of state. We explore the parameter space by varying the pre-collision velocity and the temperature of the post collision gas slab.
   Results. Slab temperature appears to play a key role in its dynamical evolution. The pressure-confined gas slab becomes Jeans unstable if the average sound crossing time, t(cr), of putative clumps condensing out of it is much longer than their respective freefall time, t(ff). Self gravitating clumps may spawn multiple/larger N-body star clusters. Warmer gas slabs are less likely to fragment and may simply end up as diffuse gas clouds.

AB Aims. We report new VLBA polarimetric observations of the compact steep-spectrum (CSS) quasar 3C 147 (B0538 + 498) at 5 and 8.4 GHz.
   Methods. By using multifrequency VLBA observations, we derived milliarcsecond-resolution images of the total intensity, polarisation, and rotation measure distributions, by combining our new observations with archival data.
   Results. The source shows a one-sided structure, with a compact region, and a component extending about 200 mas to the south-west. The compact region is resolved into two main components with polarised emission, a complex rotation measure distribution, and a magnetic field dominated by components perpendicular to the source axis.
   Conclusions. By considering all the available data, we examine the possible location of the core component, and discuss two possible interpretations of the observed structure of this source: core-jet and lobe-hot spot. Further observations to unambiguously determine the location of the core would help distinguish between the two possibilities discussed here.

AB We continue our recent work of characterizing the plasma content of high-redshift damped and sub-damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs/sub-DLAs), which represent multi-phase gaseous ( proto) galactic disks and halos seen toward a background source. We survey N V absorption in a sample of 91 DLAs and 18 sub-DLAs in the redshift range 1.67 < z(abs) < 4.28 with unblended coverage of the N V doublet. Our dataset includes high-resolution (6-8 km s(-1) FWHM) quasar spectra obtained with VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES, together with medium-resolution (approximate to 40 km s(-1) FWHM) quasar spectra from Keck/ESI. In DLAs, we find eight secure N V detections, four marginal detections, and 79 non-detections, for which we place 3 sigma upper limits on the N V column density. The detection rate of N V in DLAs is therefore 13(-4)(+5)% . Two sub-DLA N V detections are found among a sample of 18, at a similar detection rate of 11(-7)(+15) %. We show that the N V detection rate is a strong function of neutral-phase nitrogen abundance, increasing by a factor of approximate to 4 at [N/H] = [N I/ H I] > -2.3. The N V and C IV component b-value distributions in DLAs are statistically similar, but the median b(N V) of 18 km s(-1) is narrower than the median b(O VI) of approximate to 25 km s(-1). Some similar to 20% of the N V components have b < 10 km s(-1) and thus arise in warm, photoionized plasma at log (T/K) < 4.92; local sources of ionizing radiation (as opposed to the extragalactic background) are required to keep the cloud sizes physically reasonable. The nature of the remaining approximate to 80% of (broad) N V components is unclear; models of radiatively-cooling collisionally-ionized plasma at log (T/K) = 5.2-5.4 are fairly successful in reproducing the observed integrated high-ion column density ratios and the component line widths, but we cannot rule out photoionization by local sources. Finally, we identify several unusual DLAs with extremely low metallicity (< 0.01 solar) but strong high-ion absorption (log N(N V) > 14 or log N(O VI) > 14.2), which present challenges to either galactic inflow or outflow models.

AB We present the detection of carbon monoxide molecules (CO) at z = 1.6408 towards the quasar SDSS J160457.50+220300.5 using the Very Large Telescope Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph. We detected CO absorption in at least two components in the first six A-X bands and one d-X(5-0) interband system. This is the second detection of its kind along a quasar line of sight. The CO absorption profiles are well modelled by assuming rotational excitation of CO in the range 6 < T(ex) < 16 K, which is consistent with or higher than the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation at this redshift. We derive a total CO column density of N(CO) = 4 x 10(14) cm(-2). The measured column densities of S I, Mg I, Zn II, Fe II, and Si II indicate a dust depletion pattern typical of cold gas in the Galactic disc. The background quasar spectrum is significantly reddened (u - K similar to 4.5 mag) and exhibits a pronounced 2175 angstrom dust absorption feature at the redshift of the CO absorber. Using a control sample of similar to 500 quasars, we find that the chance probability that this feature is spurious is similar to 0.3%. We show that the spectral energy distribution ( SED) of the quasar is well fitted by a QSO composite spectrum reddened with a Large Magellanic Cloud supershell extinction law at the redshift of the absorber. It is noticeable that this quasar is absent from the colour-selected SDSS quasar sample. This demonstrates that our current view of the Universe may be biased against dusty sightlines. These direct observations of carbonaceous molecules and dust open up the possibility of studying the physical conditions and chemistry of diffuse molecular gas in high redshift galaxies.

A long stretch of data, new computer codes and the "Tempo" package have been used in the present analysis. We have searched for evidence of pulsed emission of gamma-rays from the Geminga pulsar using the post-glitch pulsar elements obtained by Jackson and Halpern from X-ray/gamma-ray satellite data. We do not see any significant evidence for Pulsed emission from the Geminga pulsar at a threshold energy of 825 GeV. In this paper we present Our results on the light curve in the TeV energy band, set an upper limit on the time averaged flux of gamma-rays, and compare our results with other ground based observations.

AB We present a morphological study of the 2004 August 18 solar eruption that occurred in the active region NOAA 10656 near the west limb using extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) data from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE), H alpha filtergram of Big Bear Solar Observatory, white light images of Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO), hard X-ray (HXR) data of the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), and microwave data of the Owens Valley Solar Array. In this event, we have an excellent set of observations for tracing the early evolution of the coronal mass ejection (CME) from a flux rope emergence to its propagation into space as a well-connected series of events thanks to the coronameter's field of view (FOV) down to 1.1 solar radius in an overlap with that of the TRACE. This data set reveals continuously evolving EUV, H alpha, and WL features that suggest the rise of a small, low-lying loop, its writhing motion, break of the kinked loop at its crossing point, and transformation of the ejecta to the CME. The HXR and microwave sources are found in varying locations with a complicated temporal dependence, which, we interpret, is due to two successive flares in the event. The first flare appears to be associated with the rise of the small loop, which then triggers the second flare. During the second flare a HXR coronal source is detected at the crossing point of the kinked loop, and more intriguingly, the kinked loop apparently breaks at the crossing point of the two legs, which indicates a magnetic reconnection at the X-point configuration. After the break of the kinked UV loop, a CME structure shows up in the MLSO FOV, and propagates away from the Sun. It is concluded that this CME occurred due to the kink instability.

AB A high resolution spectrum of a sunspot umbra is used for identification of rotational lines due to (0, 0) band of the A (2)I -X (2)I (+) pound system and (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 2) bands of the B (2)I (+)-X pound (2)I (+) pound system of the molecule SrF. The published sunspot umbral spectrum obtained with Fourier Transform Spectrometer and solar telescope of National Solar Observatory/National Optical Astronomy Observatory at Kitt Peak was used for the study. The new identification of more than 200 SrF lines in the umbral spectrum confirms that this molecule accounts for the majority of lines in the spectral range 15050 to 15360 cm(-1) and 17240 to 17300 cm(-1). Equivalent widths have been measured for well-resolved lines of these bands and the effective rotational temperatures have been estimated for which the presence is confirmed.

AB In this paper, we have studied periodic orbits generated by Lagrangian solutions of the restricted three body problem when more massive body is a source of radiation and the smaller primary is an oblate body. We have determined periodic orbits for fixed values of mu, sigma and different values of p and h (mu mass ratio of the two primaries, sigma oblate parameter, p radiation parameter and h energy constant). These orbits have been determined by giving displacements along the tangent and normal to the mobile co-ordinates as defined by Karimov and Sokolsky (in Celest. Mech. 46:335, 1989). These orbits have been drawn by using the predictor-corrector method. We have also studied the effect of radiation pressure on the periodic orbits by taking some fixed values of mu and sigma.

AB Following some of the recent articles on hole super-conductivity and related phenomena by Hirsch (Phys. Lett. A 134:451, 1989; Phys. Rev. B 68:184502, 2003a; Phys. Rev. B 71:184521, 2005a and Phys. Lett. A 345:453, 2005b) a simple model is proposed to explain the observed low surface magnetic field of the expected quark stars. It is argued that the diamagnetic moments of the electrons circulating in the electro-sphere induce a magnetic field, which forces the existing quark star magnetic flux density to become dilute. For the sake of completeness, we have also included the analyses of instability at the normal-super-conducting interface due to excess accumulation of magnetic flux lines. The instability at the interface has also been studied numerically.

AB We have investigated properties such as speed, angular width, location, acceleration and occurrence rate of narrow CMEs (defined as having angular width a parts per thousand currency sign20A degrees) observed during 1996-2007 by SOHO/LASCO. The results obtained are compared with those of normal CMEs (angular width > 20A degrees) from the same time interval to find whether there are any real differences between the two populations. Our study of 3464 narrow CMEs from the online SOHO/LASCO, CME catalogue leads us to conclude that (1) the fraction of narrow CMEs during solar minimum is 38% and during solar maximum 19%, (2) during solar maximum narrow CMEs are generally faster than normal CMEs, (3) the maximum speed of narrow CMEs is much smaller than that of the normal CMEs, (4) during solar maximum narrow CMEs appear at all latitudes similar to normal CMEs, (5) narrow and normal CMEs have unequal deceleration and (6) the occurrence rate of narrow CMEs remain constant after 1998 until the beginning of 2006 while the normal CMEs occurrence rate seems to follow solar cycle variation until 2004. Thus narrow CMEs and normal CMEs have some differences, in disagreement with previous studies.

AB In this paper we consider a locally-rotationally-symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type-V perfect fluid model with variable cosmological 'constant' representing the energy density of vacuum. The field equations are solved with and without heat conduction by using a variation law for the mean Hubble parameter, which is related to the average scale factor of the metric and yields a constant value of the deceleration parameter. A constant value of deceleration parameter generates power-law form of average scale factor which is used to find the exact solutions with and without heat conduction with decaying vacuum density. The solutions presented here satisfy all the necessary conditions for the physically acceptability. The thermodynamical relations in decaying vacuum fluid model are also studied in detail.

AB There has been a growing body of evidence to suggest that AGN activity, which is powered by mass accretion on to a supermasive black hole, could be episodic, although the range of time scales involved needs to be explored further. The structure and spectra of radio emission from radio galaxies, whose sizes range up to similar to 5 Mpc, contain information on the history of AGN activity in the source. They thus provide a unique opportunity to study the time scales of recurrent AGN activity. The most striking examples of recurrent activity in radio galaxies and quasars are the double-double or triple-double radio sources which contain two or three pairs of distinct lobes on opposite sides of the parent optical object. Spectral and dynamical ages of these lobes could be used to constrain time scales of episodic activity. Inverse-Compton scattered cosmic microwave background radiation could in principle probe lower Lorentz-factor particles than radio observations of synchrotron emission, and thereby reveal an older population. We review briefly the radio continuum as well as molecular and atomic gas properties of radio sources which exhibit recurrent or episodic activity, and present a few cases of quasars which require further observations to confirm their episodic nature. We also illustrate evidence of episodic AGN activity in radio sources in clusters of galaxies.

AB We present B band photometry of the delta Scuti star HD 40372 using the ARIES three channel fast photometer attached to the 104-cm Sampurnanand telescope in high-speed photometric mode. The star was observed for similar to 5 hours on December 13, 2008. Based on the high quality photometric data, we have done period analysis by various periodogram analysis techniques. The best estimate of the period is found to be similar to 0.067 days. With this period and the other stellar parameters determined from uvby beta photometry available in the literature, we have calculated the Q value for the star. Comparison of this Q value with that determined from the model calculations shows that the star is pulsating in p(3) mode with l = 2.

AB The existence of a torsion background in spacetime at cosmological scales can be tested from the timing of high-energy photons from AGN. The observations of anomalous photon dispersion from Markarian 501 by Magic gamma ray telescope can be explained by the presence of torsion background and it puts limits on the torsion background at kappa S (0) < 10(-18) GeV-1.

We investigate three specializations, the first characterized by a vanishing effective pressure, the second provided with a constant effective density and the third described by a constant effective pressure p(0). For these specializations we will discuss the models assuming that sigma e(lambda/2) = sigma(0)r(s), where sigma, sigma(0), lambda and s represent the charge density of the spherical distribution, the charge density at the center of the system, the metric potential and a constant, respectively. In addition, for specialization I, we have found the isotropic coordinate as well as the Kretschmann scalar for a particular case, and for specialization III two special scenarios have been studied.

AB The inflaton field responsible for inflation may not be a canonical fundamental scalar. It is possible that the inflaton is a composite of fermions or it may have a decay width. In these cases the standard procedure for calculating the power spectrum is not applicable and a new formalism needs to be developed to determine the effect of short range interactions of the inflaton on the power spectrum and the CMB anisotropy. We develop a general formalism for computing the power spectrum of curvature perturbations for such non-canonical cases by using the flat space Kallen-Lehmann spectral function in curved quaside Sitter space assuming implicitly that the Bunch-Davis boundary conditions enforces the inflaton mode functions to be plane wave in the short wavelength limit and a complete set of mode functions exists in quasi-de Sitter space. It is observed that the inflaton with a decay width suppresses the power at large scale while a composite inflaton's power spectrum oscillates at large scales. These observations may be vindicated in the WMAP data and confirmed by future observations with PLANCK.

ID ASTROPHYSICAL SOURCES; MUON
AB It is widely believed that charm meson production and decay may play an important role in high energy astrophysical sources of neutrinos, especially those thar are baryon-rich, providing an environment conducive to pp interactions. Using slow-jet supernovae (SJS) as an example of such a source we study the detectability of high-energy neutrinos, paying particular attention to those produced from charmed-mesons. We highlight important distinguishing features in the ultra-high energy neutrino flux which would act as markers for the role of charm in the source. In particular, charm leads to significant event rates at higher energies, after the conventional (pi,K) neutrino fluxes fall off. We calculate event rates both for a nearby single source and for diffuse SJS fluxes for an IceCube-like detector. By comparing muon event rates for the conventional and promp fluxes in different energy bins, we demonstrate the striking energy dependence in the rates induced by the presence of charm. We also show that it leads to an energy dependant flux ration of shower to muon events, providing an additional important diagnostic tool for the presentce of prompt neutrinos. Motivated by the infusion of high energy anti-electron into the flux by charm decay, we also study the detectability of the Glashow resonance due to these sources.

ID RELATIVISTIC PLASMA; UNIVERSE; ELECTRODYNAMICS
AB Following the wellknown spacetime decomposition technique as applied to (d vertical bar 1) dimensions we write down the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in a spatially flat generalised FRW universe. Assuming an equation of state for the background cosmic fluid we find solutions in turn for acoustic waves and also for Alfven waves in a warm (cold) magnetised plasma. Interestingly the different plasma modes closely resemble the flat space counterparts except that here the field variables all redshift with their time due to the expansion of the background. It is observed that in the ultrarelativistic limit the field parameters all scale as the free photon. The situation changes in the prerelativistic limit where the frequencies change in a bizarre fashion depending on initial conditions. It is observed that for a fixed magnetic field in a particular medium the Alfven wave velocity decreases with the number of dimensions, being the maximum in the usual 4D. Further for a fixed dimension the velocity attenuation is more significant in dust compared to the radiation era. We also find that in an expanding background the Alfven wave propagation is possible only in the high frequency range, determined by the strength of the external magnetic field, the mass density of the medium and also the dimensions of the spacetime. Further it is found that with expansion the cosmic magnetic field decays more sharply in higher dimensional cosmology, which is in line with observational demand.

AB We consider Brans-Dicke type nonminimally coupled scalar field as a candidate for dark energy. In the conformally transformed Einstein's frame, our model is a coupled quintessence model. In such models, we consider potentials for the scalar field which satisfy the slow-roll conditions: [(1/V)(dV/d phi)](2) << 1 and (1/V)(d(2)V/d phi(2)) << 1. For such potentials, we show that the equation of state for the scalar field can be described by a universal behaviour, provided the scalar field rolls only in the flat part of the potentials where the slow-roll conditions are satisfied. Our work generalizes the previous work by Scherrer and Sen [7] for minimally coupled scalar field case. We have also studied the observational constraints on the model parameters considering the Supernova and BAO observational data.

AB We present the results of a systematic Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) survey of 21-cm absorption in a representative and unbiased sample of 35 strong MgII systems in the redshift range: z(abs) similar to 1.10-1.45, 33 of which have W-r >= 1 angstrom. The survey using similar to 400 h of telescope time has resulted in nine new 21-cm detections and stringent 21-cm optical depth upper limits (median 3 sigma optical depth per 10 km s(-1) of 0.017) for the remaining 26 systems. This is by far the largest number of 21-cm detections from any single survey of intervening absorbers. Prior to our survey, no intervening 21-cm system was known in the above redshift range, and only one system was known in the redshift range 0.7 <= z <= 1.5. We discuss the relation between the detectability of 21-cm absorption and various properties of UV absorption lines. We show that if MgII systems are selected with the following criteria, MgII doublet ratio <= 1.3 and W-r(Mg I)/W-r(Mg II) >= 0.3, then a detection rate of 21-cm absorption up to 90 per cent can be achieved. We estimate n(21), the number per unit redshift of 21-cm absorbers with W-r(Mg II) > W-o and integrated optical depth T-21 > T-o, and show that n(21) decreases with increasing redshift. In particular, for W-o = 1.0 angstrom and T-o > 0.3 km s(-1), n(21) falls by a factor of 4 from < z > = 0.5 to < z > = 1.3. The evolution seems to be stronger for stronger Mg II systems. Using a subsample of systems for which high-frequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images are available, we show that the effect is not related to the structure of the background radio sources and is most probably due to the evolution of the cold neutral medium filling factor in MgII systems. We find no correlation between the velocity spread of the 21-cm absorption feature and W-r(Mg II) at z similar to 1.3.

AB We present near-infrared (1-2.5 mu m) spectroscopic and photometric results of Nova V2615 Ophiuchi which was discovered in outburst in 2007 March. Our observations span a period of similar to 80 d starting from 2007 March 28 when the nova was at its maximum light. The evolution of the spectra is shown from the initial P Cygni phase to an emission-line phase and finally to a dust formation stage. The characteristics of the JHK spectra are very similar to those observed in a nova outburst occurring on a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. We analyse an observed line at 2.088 mu m and suggest that it could be due to Fe ii excited by Lyman alpha fluorescence. The highlight of the observations is the detection of the first overtone bands of carbon monoxide (CO) in the 2.29-2.40 mu m region. The CO bands are modelled to estimate the temperature and mass of the emitting CO gas and also to place limits on the (12)C/(13)C ratio. The CO bands are recorded over several epochs, thereby allowing a rare opportunity to study the evolution from a phase of constant strength through a stage when the CO is destroyed fairly rapidly. We compare the observed time-scales involved in the evolution of the CO emission and find a good agreement with model predictions that investigate the chemistry in a nova outflow during the early stages.

AB We present optical and submillimetre polarimetry data of the Bok globule CB3. We also present optical polarimetry and submillimetre continuum data of the Bok globule CB246. We use each set of polarimetry data to infer the magnetic field orientation in each of the clouds. The optical data can only trace the field orientation in the low-density edge regions of clouds, because if the extinction is too high then no optical emission is transmitted. The submillimetre data can only trace the field orientation in the high-density central regions of the clouds, because current submillimetre polarimeters are only sensitive to high column densities.
   It has previously been found that near-infrared polarization mapping of background stars does not accurately trace the magnetic field in dense cloud regions, and hence that the grains responsible for near-infrared polarization are under-represented in those regions. This may be due to a lack of aligned grains in dense regions. We test this by comparing the field orientations measured by our two independent methods of optical and submillimetre polarimetry. We find that the field orientation deduced from the optical data matches up well with the orientation estimated from the submillimetre data. We therefore claim that both methods are accurately tracing the same magnetic field in CB3. Hence, in this case, there must be significant numbers of aligned dust grains in the high-density region, and they do indeed trace the magnetic field in the submillimetre.
   We find an offset of 40 degrees +/- 14 degrees between the magnetic field orientation and the short axis of the globule. This is consistent with the mean value of 31 degrees +/- 3 degrees found in our previous work on pre-stellar cores, even though CB3 is a protostellar core. CB246 is a pre-stellar core, and in this case the offset between the magnetic field orientation inferred from the optical polarization data and the short axis of the core inferred from the submillimetre continuum data is 28 degrees +/- 20 degrees. Taken together, the six pre-stellar cores that we have now studied in this way show a mean offset between magnetic field orientation and core short axis of similar to 30 degrees +/- 3 degrees, in apparent contradiction with some models of magnetically dominated star formation.

AB The high-resolution image of the jet of the BL Lac object MKN501 in radio shows a limb-brightened feature. An explanation of this feature as an outcome of the differential Doppler boosting of jet spine and jet boundary due to transverse velocity structure of the jet requires large viewing angle. However, this inference contradicts with the constraints derived from the high-energy gamma-ray studies unless the jets bend over a large angle immediately after the gamma-ray zone (close to the central engine). In this Letter, we propose an alternate explanation to the limb-brightened feature of MKN501 by considering the diffusion of electrons accelerated at the boundary shear layer into the jet medium, and this consideration does not require large viewing angle. Also, the observed difference in the spectral index at the jet boundary and jet spine can be understood within the framework of shear acceleration.

ID BRANE INFLATION; STRINGS; INTERFEROMETER
AB We report on a matched-filter search for gravitational wave bursts from cosmic string cusps using LIGO data from the fourth science run (S4) which took place in February and March 2005. No gravitational waves were detected in 14.9 days of data from times when all three LIGO detectors were operating. We interpret the result in terms of a frequentist upper limit on the rate of gravitational wave bursts and use the limits on the rate to constrain the parameter space (string tension, reconnection probability, and loop sizes) of cosmic string models. Many grand unified theory-scale models (with string tension G mu/c(2) approximate to 10(-6)) can be ruled out at 90% confidence for reconnection probabilities p <= 10(-3) if loop sizes are set by gravitational back reaction.

ID MASS; COALESCENCES; EVENTS
AB According to general relativity a perturbed black hole will settle to a stationary configuration by the emission of gravitational radiation. Such a perturbation will occur, for example, in the coalescence of a black hole binary, following their inspiral and subsequent merger. At late times the waveform is a superposition of quasinormal modes, which we refer to as the ringdown. The dominant mode is expected to be the fundamental mode, l = m = 2. Since this is a well-known waveform, matched filtering can be implemented to search for this signal using LIGO data. We present a search for gravitational waves from black hole ringdowns in the fourth LIGO science run S4, during which LIGO was sensitive to the dominant mode of perturbed black holes with masses in the range of 10M(circle dot) to 500M(circle dot), the regime of intermediate-mass black holes, to distances up to 300 Mpc. We present a search for gravitational waves from black hole ringdowns using data from S4. No gravitational wave candidates were found; we place a 90%-confidence upper limit on the rate of ringdowns from black holes with mass between 85M(circle dot) and 390M(circle dot) in the local universe, assuming a uniform distribution of sources, of 3.2 x 10(-5) yr(-1) Mpc(-3) = 1.6 x 10(-3) yr(-1) L-10(-1), where L-10 is 10(10) times the solar blue- light luminosity.

AB An unconstrained minimal supersymmetric standard model with the superpartners of the strongly interacting particles very heavy (close to the kinematic reach of the LHC or even beyond it) and a relatively light electroweak sector is considered. Using the event generator PYTHIA it is shown that the 1 tau-jet (tagged) + 2l and 2 tau-jets (tagged) + 1l signals with a reasonably hard (E) over bar (T) spectrum either by themselves or in combination with the conventional 3l signal, which is known to be of rather modest size with a soft (E) over bar (T) spectrum, may appreciably extend the reach of chargino-neutralino search at the LHC with 10 fb(-1) of integrated luminosity. This is especially so if the lighter chargino and the second lightest neutralino decays via two body leptonic modes with large branching ratios. The theoretical motivation of this scenario, yielding large values of the fine-tuning parameters but consistent with various indirect constraints including the dark matter relic density, is briefly discussed. It is shown that in the minimal supergravity model with an universal scalar mass at the grand unified theory scale, the signals involving tau-jets are not viable. Theoretically well-motivated variations of these boundary conditions are, however, adequate for reviving these signals.

AB The formulation of weak isolated horizons (WIH) based on the standard isolated horizon formulation of black hole horizons has been reconsidered in the context of the Holst action. Both the zeroth and the first laws of WIH mechanics have been derived. While the zeroth law follows directly from the WIH boundary conditions, first law depends on the action chosen. We construct the covariant phase space of the Holst action for a space-time having WIH as the inner boundary. This requires the introduction of new potential functions so that the symplectic structure is foliation independent. We show that a precise cancellation among various terms leads to the usual first law. Subsequently, we show from the same covariant phase space that for spherically symmetric horizons, the effective theory on the inner boundary is a U(1) Chern-Simons theory.

AB The Randall-Sundrum model of warped geometry in a five-dimensional scenario, aimed at explaining the hierarchy between the Planck and electroweak scales, is intrinsically unstable in its minimal form due to negative tension of the visible brane. A proposed solution to the problem yields a negative cosmological constant in four dimensions. We show that this wrong-sign cosmological constant is restricted to small values, therefore requiring less cancellation from hitherto unknown physics, if bulk neutrinos are postulated to explain the observed neutrino mass pattern. Thus neutrino masses, a stable TeV-brane configuration and new physics in the context of the cosmological constant get rather suggestively connected by the same thread.

TI Bulk spacetimes for cosmological braneworlds with a time-dependent extra

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID BRANE; CONSTANT; RELATIVITY; UNIVERSE; WORLD
AB We explore the possibilities of constructing bulk spacetimes in five dimensions for warped braneworld models with a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker line element on the 3-brane and with a time-dependent extra dimension. Our first step in this direction involves looking at the status of energy conditions when such a bulk line element is assumed. We check these conditions by analyzing the relevant inequalities-for specific functional forms (chosen to satisfy certain desirable features) of the warp factor-the cosmological scale factor, and the extra-dimensional scale factor. Subsequently, we aim to obtain solutions with different types of bulk matter sources. We begin with a general analysis of the solution space of nonsingular Randall-Sundrum-type bulk models with an exponential warp factor and a chosen equation of state. Thereafter, we focus on three specific bulk sources-the ordinary scalar field, the Brans-Dicke scalar, and the dilaton. In each case, we are able to solve the field equations and obtain desirable solutions, for which we once again check the viability of the energy conditions. We also show how one can place branes in the bulk using the junction conditions. The issue of resolution of the bulk singularities which appear in our solutions, using standard methods, is also presented briefly. In summary, we are able to demonstrate that it is indeed possible to construct viable bulk spacetimes for warped cosmological braneworlds with a time-varying extra dimension and with bulk matter satisfying the energy conditions.

AB We investigate in a model-independent way to what extent one can perturb tribimaximal mixing in order to generate a sizable value of vertical bar U-e3 vertical bar, while at the same time keeping solar neutrino mixing near its measured value, which is close to sin(2)theta(12) = 1/3. Three straightforward breaking mechanisms to generate vertical bar U-e3 vertical bar similar or equal to 0.1 are considered. For charged lepton corrections, the suppression of a sizable contribution to sin(2)theta(12) can be achieved if CP violation in neutrino oscillations is almost maximal. Generation of the indicated value of vertical bar U-e3 vertical bar similar or equal to 0.1 through renormalization group corrections requires the neutrinos to be quasidegenerate in mass. The consistency with the allowed range of sin(2)theta(12) together with large running of vertical bar U-e3 vertical bar forces one of the Majorana phases to be close to pi. This implies large cancellations in the effective Majorana mass governing neutrinoless double beta ((beta beta)(0 nu)) decay, constraining it to lie near its minimum allowed value of m(0) cos2 theta(12), where m(0) greater than or similar to 0.1 eV. Finally, explicit breaking of the neutrino mass matrix in the inverted hierarchical and quasidegenerate neutrino mass spectrum cases is similarly correlated with the (beta beta)(0 nu)-decay effective Majorana mass, although to a lesser extent. The implied values for the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle theta(23) are given in all cases.

AB We construct a new realization of type-II seesaw for neutrino masses and baryon asymmetry by extending the standard model with one light and two heavy singlet scalars besides one Higgs triplet. The heavy singlets pick up small vacuum expectation values to give a suppressed trilinear coupling between the triplet and doublet Higgs bosons after the light singlet drives the spontaneous breaking of lepton number. The Higgs triplet can thus remain light and be accessible at the LHC. The lepton-number conserving decays of the heavy singlets can generate a lepton asymmetry stored in the Higgs triplet to account for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. We further introduce stable gauge bosons from a hidden sector, which obtain masses and annihilate into the Higgs triplet after spontaneous breaking of the associated non-Abelian gauge symmetry. With Breit-Wigner enhancement, the stable gauge bosons can simultaneously explain the relic density of dark matter and the cosmic positron/electron excesses.

AB A new non-singular analytical theory for the motion of near-Earth satellite orbits with the air drag effect is developed in terms of uniformly regular KS canonical elements. Diurnally varying oblate atmosphere is considered with variation in density scale height dependent on altitude. The series expansion method is utilized to generate the analytical solutions and terms up to fourth-order terms in eccentricity and c (a small parameter dependent on the flattening of the atmosphere) are retained. Only two of the nine equations are solved analytically to compute the state vector and change in energy at the end of each revolution, due to symmetry in the equations of motion. The important drag perturbed orbital parameters: semi-major axis and eccentricity are obtained up to 500 revolutions, with the present analytical theory and by numerical integration over a wide range of perigee height, eccentricity and inclination. The differences between the two are found to be very less. A comparison between the theories generated with terms up to third- and fourth-order terms in c and e shows an improvement in the computation of the orbital parameters semi-major axis and eccentricity, up to 9%. The theory can be effectively used for the re-entry of the near-Earth objects, which mainly decay due to atmospheric drag. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The positions of equilibrium points and their linear stabilities for various values of perturbing parameters are studied. It is found that the positions of the equilibrium points are different from the positions in the classical restricted three body problem. When the P-R effect is taken into account, these points are unstable in a linear sense. It is also found that the equilibrium points are unstable when the mass of the belt M-b >= 0.4.

AB Within the nu MSSM, a Minimal Supersymmetric neutrino See-saw Model, Lepton Flavour Violating Higgs couplings are strongly enhanced at large tan beta (greater than or similar to 30), which can lead to BR(H-0/A(0) -> tau mu) similar or equal to O(10(-4)), for M-H0/A0 greater than or similar to 160 GeV. Enhancements on the production of Higgs bosons, through the gluon fusion mechanism, -> H-0/A(0), and the associated production channel gg, q (q) over bar b (b) over barH(0)/A(0), whose rates grow with tan beta, as well as the mass degeneracy that occurs between the H-0 and A(0) states in this regime, also contribute to further the possibilities to detect a heavy Higgs signal into tau mu pairs. We show that the separation of tau mu Higgs events from the background at the upcoming CERN Large Hadron Collider could be done for Higgs masses up to about 600 GeV for 300 fb(-1) of luminosity, for large tan beta values. However, even with as little as 10 fb(-1) one can probe H-0/A(0) masses up to 400 GeV or so, if tan beta = 60. Altogether, these processes then provide a new Higgs discovery mode as well as an independent test of flavour physics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Spontaneous parity violation in a supersymmetric left-right symmetric

SO PHYSICS LETTERS B

DT Article
ID R-PARITY; OSCILLATIONS; MASS
AB We propose a novel implementation of spontaneous parity breaking in supersymmetric left-right symmetric model, avoiding some of the problems encountered in previous studies. This implementation includes a bi-triplet and a singlet, in addition to the bi-doublets which extend the Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The supersymmetric vacua of this theory are shown to lead generically to spontaneous violation of parity, while preserving R-parity. The model is shown to reproduce the see-saw relation for vacuum expectation values, nu(L) nu(R) approximate to 2 m(EW)(2) relating the new mass scales nu(L) nu(R) to the electroweak scale m(EW), just as in the non-supersymmetric version. The scale nu(R) determines the mass scale of heavy Majorana neutrinos, which gets related to the observed neutrino masses through type II see-saw relation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We compute the cosmological constant in a scale invariant scalar field theory. The gravitational action is also suitably modified to respect scale invariance. Due to scale invariance, the theory does not admit a cosmological constant term. The scale invariance is broken by a recently introduced mechanism called cosmological symmetry breaking. This leads to a nonzero cosmological constant. We compute the one-loop corrections to the cosmological constant and show that it is finite.

AB We study the effects of the interaction terms between the inflation fields on the inflationary dynamics in multi-field models. With power law type potential and interactions, the total number of e-folds may get considerably reduced and can lead to unacceptably short period of inflation. Also we point out that this can place a bound on the characteristic scale of the underlying theory such as string theory. Using a simple multi-field chaotic inflation model from string theory, the string scale is constrained to be larger than the scale of grand unified theory. Allowing post-inflationary generation of perturbation can greatly alleviate this constrian.

AB The role of electrodynamics in producing additional stratifications in the equatorial F region (F-3 layer) at dawn and dusk during geomagnetic storms is discussed. Two cases of F-3 layer at dawn (0600-0730 LT on 5 October 2000 and 8 December 2000) and one case of F-3 layer at dusk (1600-1730 LT on 5 October 2000) are observed, for the first time, by the digital ionosonde at the equatorial station Trivandrum (8.5 degrees N; 77 degrees E; dip similar to 0.5 degrees N) in India. The unusual F-3 layers occurred during the geomagnetic storms and are associated with southward turning of interplanetary magnetic field B-z, suggesting that eastward prompt penetration electric field could be the main cause of the F-3 layers. The dawn F-3 layer on 5 October is modeled using the Sheffield University Plasmasphere-Ionosphere Model by using the E x B drift estimated from the real height variation of the ionospheric peak during the morning period. The model qualitatively reproduces the dawn F-3 layer. While the existing F-2 layer rapidly drifts upward and forms the F-3 layer and topside ledge, a new layer forming at lower heights develops into the normal F-2 layer.

We consider the wave function collapse process for the constituents of dark matter in our universe. Beginning from a particular early era of the universe chosen from physical considerations, the rate of the associated energy liberation is integrated to yield the requisite magnitude of dark energy around the era of galaxy formation. Further, the equation of state for the liberated energy approaches w -> -1 asymptotically, providing a mechanism to generate the present acceleration of the universe. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB We study modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) as a candidate for dark energy and predict the values of parameters of the gas for a physically viable cosmological model. The equation of state of MCG (p = B rho - A/rho(alpha)) involves three parameters: B, A and alpha. The permitted values of these parameters are determined with the help of a dimensionless age parameter (H(0)t(0)) and H(z) - z data. Specifically, we study the allowed ranges of values of the B parameter in terms of alpha and A(s) (A(s) is defined in terms of the parameters in the theory). We explore the constraints of the parameters in the cold dark matter and unified dark matter energy models, respectively.

AB We have combined the results from our recent observations of damped and sub-damped Lyman alpha (sub-DLA) systems with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle and Ultraviolet Visual Echelle Spectrograph on the Magellan Clay and Very Large Telescopes with ones from the literature to determine the N(HI)-weighted mean metallicity of these systems based both on Fe, a depleted element in quasi-stellar object absorbers and the local interstellar medium, and Zn a relatively undepleted element. In each case, the N(HI)-weighted mean metallicity is higher and shows faster evolution in sub-DLAs than the classical DLA systems. Large grids of photoionization models over the sub-DLA N(HI) range with CLOUDY show that the ionization corrections to the abundances are in general small, however the fraction of ionized H can be up to similar to 90 per cent. The individual spectra have been shifted to the rest frame of the absorber and averaged together to determine the average properties of these systems at z < 1.5. We find that the average abundance pattern of the sub-DLA systems is similar to the gas in the halo of the Milky Way, with an offset of similar to 0.3 dex in the overall metallicity. Both DLAs and sub-DLAs show similar characteristics in their relative abundances patterns, although the DLAs have smaller <[Mn/Zn]> as well as higher <[Ti/Zn]> and <[Cr/Zn]>. We calculate the contribution of sub-DLAs to the metal budget of the Universe, and find that the sub-DLA systems at z < 1.5 contain a comoving density of metals Omega(met) similar to (3.5-15.8) x 10(5) M(circle dot) Mpc(-3), at least twice the comoving density of metals in the DLA systems. The sub-DLAs do, however, track global chemical evolution models much more closely than do the DLAs, perhaps indicating that they are a less dust biased metallicity indicator of galaxies at high redshifts than the DLA systems.

AB The recently discovered apparent dramatic expansion in the effective radii of massive elliptical galaxies from z similar or equal to 2 to similar or equal to 0.1 has been interpreted in terms of either galaxy mergers or the rapid loss of cold gas due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. In examining the latter case, we have quantified the extent of the expansion, which is uncertain observationally, in terms of the star formation parameters and time of the expulsion of the cold gas. In either case, the large global decrease in stellar density should translate into a major drop in the interstellar medium density and pressure with cosmic epoch. These cosmological changes are expected to have a major influence on the gas accretion mode, which will shift from 'cold' thin disc accretion at high redshifts towards 'hot' Bondi fed Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) accretion at low redshifts. The decline of angular momentum inflow would then lead to a spin down of the black hole, for which we have calculated more precise time-scales; a value of about 0.2 Gyr is typical for a 10(9) M(circle dot) central black hole. These results have implications for the different cosmological evolutionary patterns found for the luminosity functions of powerful and weak radio galaxies.

AB Primordial magnetic fields lead to non-Gaussian signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) even at the lowest order, as magnetic stresses and the temperature anisotropy they induce depend quadratically on the magnetic field. In contrast, CMB non-Gaussianity due to inflationary scalar perturbations arises only as a higher-order effect. We propose a novel probe of stochastic primordial magnetic fields that exploits the characteristic CMB non-Gaussianity that they induce. We compute the CMB bispectrum (b(l1)l(2)l(3)) induced by such fields on large angular scales. We find a typical value of l(1)(l(1)+1)l(3)(l(3)+1)b(l1)l(2)l(3)similar to 10(-22), for magnetic fields of strength B-0 similar to 3 nG and with a nearly scale invariant magnetic spectrum. Observational limits on the bispectrum allow us to set upper limits on B-0 similar to 35 nG.

TI RADIO PULSAR BINARIES IN GLOBULAR CLUSTERS: THEIR ORBITAL ECCENTRICITIES

AB High sensitivity searches of globular clusters ( GCs) for radio pulsars by improved pulsar search algorithms and sustained pulsar timing observations have so far yielded some 140 pulsars in more than two dozen GCs. The observed distribution of orbital eccentricity and period of binary radio pulsars in GCs have imprints of the past interaction between single pulsars and binary systems or of binary pulsars and single passing noncompact stars. It is seen that GCs have different groups of pulsars. These may have arisen out of exchange or merger of a component of the binary with the incoming star or a "fly-by" in which the original binary remains intact but undergoes a change of eccentricity and orbital period. We consider the genesis of the distribution of pulsars using analytical and computational tools such as STARLAB, which performs numerical scattering experiments with direct N-body integration. Cluster pulsars with intermediate eccentricities can mostly be accounted for by fly-bys, whereas those with high eccentricities are likely to be the result of exchanges and/or mergers of single stars with the binary companion of the pulsar, although there are a few objects which do not easily fit into this description. The corresponding distribution for galactic field pulsars shows notable differences from the GC pulsar orbital period and eccentricity distribution. The long orbital period pulsars in the galactic field with frozen out low eccentricities are largely missing from the GCs, and we show that the ionization of these systems in GCs cannot alone account for the peculiarities.

AB We present the results of a LIGO search for short-duration gravitational waves (GWs) associated with the 2006 March 29 SGR 1900+14 storm. A new search method is used, "stacking" the GW data around the times of individual soft-gamma bursts in the storm to enhance sensitivity for models in which multiple bursts are accompanied by GW emission. We assume that variation in the time difference between burst electromagnetic emission and potential burst GW emission is small relative to the GW signal duration, and we time-align GW excess power time-frequency tilings containing individual burst triggers to their corresponding electromagnetic emissions. We use two GW emission models in our search: a fluence-weighted model and a flat (unweighted) model for the most electromagnetically energetic bursts. We find no evidence of GWs associated with either model. Model-dependent GW strain, isotropic GW emission energy E(GW), and gamma = E(GW)/E(EM) upper limits are estimated using a variety of assumed waveforms. The stacking method allows us to set the most stringent model-dependent limits on transient GW strain published to date. We find E(GW) upper limit estimates (at a nominal distance of 10 kpc) of between 2 x 10(45) erg and 6 x 10(50) erg depending on the waveform type. These limits are an order of magnitude lower than upper limits published previously for this storm and overlap with the range of electromagnetic energies emitted in soft gamma repeater (SGR) giant flares.

TI QUASINORMAL MODES OF RN BLACK HOLE SPACETIME WITH COSMIC STRING IN A

ID DOMAIN-WALLS; STABILITY
AB We evaluate quasinormal mode frequencies for RN black hole spacetimes with cosmic string perturbed by a massless Dirac field, using Poschl-Teller potential method. We find that only in the case of RN black hole having small charge, the effect due to cosmic string will dominate when perturbed by a negatively charged Dirac field, but if we are perturbing with positively charged Dirac field decay will be less in the case of black hole having cosmic string compared to the RN black hole without string.

ID STRING COSMOLOGY; SPECTRUM; GEO
AB A stochastic background of gravitational waves is expected to arise from a superposition of a large number of unresolved gravitational-wave sources of astrophysical and cosmological origin. It should carry unique signatures from the earliest epochs in the evolution of the Universe, inaccessible to standard astrophysical observations(1). Direct measurements of the amplitude of this background are therefore of fundamental importance for understanding the evolution of the Universe when it was younger than one minute. Here we report limits on the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational-wave background using the data from a two-year science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory(2) (LIGO). Our result constrains the energy density of the stochastic gravitational-wave background normalized by the critical energy density of the Universe, in the frequency band around 100 Hz, to be <6.9 X 10(-6) at 95% confidence. The data rule out models of early Universe evolution with relatively large equation-of-state parameter(3), as well as cosmic (super) string models with relatively small string tension(4) that are favoured in some string theory models(5). This search for the stochastic background improves on the indirect limits from Big Bang nucleosynthesis(1,6) and cosmic microwave background(7) at 100Hz.

AB Magnetic decreases (MDs) have been identified and studied throughout a Ulysses fast latitude scan that lasted from 29 February 1992 to 14 September 1993. Ulysses' distance was similar to 5 AU from the Sun. MDs were unbiasedly selected by application of the Interplanetary Magnetic Decrease Automatic Detection code. MDs were found to occur in high-occurrence-frequency "clusters'' with the top 10 peak events varying in magnitude from 116 MDs per day to 36 MDs per day. For comparative purposes, quiet, nonpeak intervals had an occurrence rate of 4.3 MDs per day. Each of the 10 MD clusters was analyzed in detail to determine their solar wind dependences. MD clusters were often found to occur within corotating interaction regions (CIRs), mainly localized in the trailing portions of CIRs between the interface ( IF) and the reverse shock (RS). The MD clusters were divided into smaller subclusters. Within the limits of this study, MD subclusters were always found to occur in high-beta (1<beta<10(2)) regions (HBRs). Small MD subclusters were detected in HBRs downstream of forward shocks (FSs) but less frequently than for the trailing portion of the CIR. The FS to IF region is generally a low-beta region (LBR), where beta <= 1.0. The 3920 MDs were identified in the study. The temporal thickness distribution of MDs is given by N = 2173 e(-(t/17.3)), where t is in seconds. The magnetic field angular changes were calculated across MDs. The angular dependence is % MDs = 2 + 48e(-(Delta Theta degrees/18.8 degrees)). Only 13.5% of MDs were "linear'' with angular changes <10 degrees across the structures. Because MDs are found in abundance in the region spanning the CIR RS to close to the IF, it is argued that MDs must be formed continuously from close to the Sun (r < 0.5 AU) to similar to 5 AU. The older MDs ( those found close to the IF) are "fossils'' that have been convected radially outward to similar to 5 AU. A scenario is presented to explain the HBRs downstream of both CIR RSs and quasi-parallel FSs. The location of MD clusters in the trailing parts of CIRs and the paucity of linear MDs indicate that MD generation by mirror mode instability is unlikely. More promising candidates are shock compression of phase-steepened Alfven waves, shock-directional discontinuity interactions, and downstream turbulence. We emphasize the phase-steepened Alfven wave mechanism.

AB Leptogenesis is usually realized through decays of heavy particles. In this Letter we consider another possibility of generating a lepton asymmetry through annihilations of heavy particles. We demonstrate our idea with a realistic extension of the standard model containing a heavy doublet and a light singlet scalars in addition to right-handed neutrinos and Higgs triplets required for type-I + II seesaw of neutrino masses. we also clarify that this annihilating leptogenesis scenario can be naturally embedded in more fundamental theories, like left-right symmetric models or grand unified theories.

AB Fractal concepts have been introduced in the accretion disc as a new feature. Due to the fractal nature of the flow, its continuity condition undergoes modifications. The conserved stationary fractal flow admits only saddle points and centre-type points in its phase portrait. Completely analytical solutions of the equilibrium point conditions indicate that the fractal properties enable the flow to behave like an effective continuum of lesser density, and facilitate the generation of transonicity. However, strongly fractal flows inhibit multitransonicity from developing. The mass accretion rate exhibits a fractal scaling behaviour, and the entire fractal accretion disc is stable under linearized dynamic perturbations.

AB We study the relationship between the gas column density (Sigma(gas)) and the star formation rate (SFR) surface density (Sigma(SFR)) for a sample of 23 extremely faint dwarf irregular galaxies drawn from the Faint Irregular Galaxy GMRT (Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope) Survey (FIGGS). Our sample galaxies have a median H i mass of 2.8 x 10(7) M(circle dot) and a median blue magnitude M(B) similar to -13.2. Sigma(SFR) is derived from Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) data, while Sigma(gas) is derived from the GMRT-based FIGGS H i 21-cm survey data. We find that Sigma(gas) averaged over the star-forming region of the disc lies below most estimates of the 'threshold density' for star formation, and that the average Sigma(SFR) is also lower than would be expected from the 'Kennicutt-Schmidt' law. This deviation is indicative of an environmental dependence of star formation efficiencies, since the Kennicutt relation was derived from data on the central regions of large spiral and starburst galaxies. The star formation efficiency in small galaxies may be more relevant to modelling of star formation in gas-rich, low-metallicity systems in the early universe. We also use our data to look for small-scale (400 and 200 pc) correlations between Sigma(SFR) and Sigma(gas). For 18 of our 23 galaxies, we find that Sigma(SFR) can be parametrized as having a power-law dependence on Sigma(gas). The power-law relation holds until one reaches the sensitivity limit of the GALEX data, i.e. we find no evidence for a 'threshold density' below which star formation is completely cut off. The power-law slopes and coefficients however vary substantially from galaxy to galaxy, and are in general steeper than the value of similar to 1.4 derived for large galaxies by Kennicutt. Further, as for the globally averaged quantities, the Sigma(SFR) at 400 pc resolution is in general lower than that predicted by the Kennicutt relation, with the deviation decreasing with increasing Sigma(gas). Our computation of Sigma(SFR) uses a calibration that assumes solar metallicity and a standard Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), similarly, the Sigma(gas) we use is not corrected for the molecular gas density. Incorporating corrections for molecular gas and low metallicity will increase the deviation from the Kennicutt relation. Conversely, truncating the IMF at the high-mass end would decrease the deviation from the Kennicutt relation. For the five galaxies for which a power law does not provide a good parametrization of the (Sigma(SFR), Sigma(gas)) relation, there are substantial offsets between the ultraviolet (UV) bright regions and the H i high column density maps. Four of these five galaxies have H i masses near the lower end of our sample distribution, while the remaining galaxy has a large central H i hole. We have 200 pc resolution images for 10 of our galaxies. At this resolution, the offsets between the peaks in the H i and UV images are more pronounced, and a power-law parametrization is possible for only five of the 10 galaxies.

AB The Orion Bar is one of the nearest and best-studied photodissociation or photon-dominated regions (PDRs). Observations reveal the presence of H-2 lines from vibrationally or rotationally excited upper levels that suggest warm gas temperatures (400-700 K). However, standard models of PDRs are unable to reproduce such warm rotational temperatures. In this paper, we attempt to explain these observations with new comprehensive models which extend from the H+ region through the Bar and include the magnetic field in the equation of state. We adopt the model parameters from our previous paper which successfully reproduced a wide variety of spectral observations across the Bar. In this model, the local cosmic ray density is enhanced above the galactic background, as is the magnetic field, and which increases the cosmic ray heating elevating the temperature in the molecular region. The pressure is further enhanced above the gas pressure in the H+ region by the momentum transferred from the absorbed starlight. Here, we investigate whether the observed H2 lines can be reproduced with standard assumptions concerning the grain photoelectric emission. We also explore the effects due to the inclusion of recently computed H-2 + H-2, H-2 + H, and H-2 + He collisional rate coefficients.

AB Any discrete approach to quantum gravity must provide some prescription as to how to deduce continuum properties from the discrete substructure. In the causal set approach it is straightforward to deduce timelike distances, but surprisingly difficult to extract spacelike distances, because of the unique combination of discreteness with local Lorentz invariance in that approach. We propose a number of methods to overcome this difficulty, one of which reproduces the spatial distance between two points in a finite region of Minkowski space. We provide numerical evidence that this definition can be used to define a 'spatial nearest neighbor' relation on a causal set, and conjecture that this can be exploited to define the length of 'continuous curves' in causal sets which are approximated by curved spacetime. This provides some evidence in support of the 'Hauptvermutung' of causal sets.

AB The GIII red giant star epsilon Oph has been found to exhibit several modes of oscillation by the MOST mission. We interpret the observed frequencies of oscillation in terms of theoretical radial p-mode frequencies of stellar models. Evolutionary models of this star, in both shell H-burning and core He-burning phases of evolution, are constructed using as constraints a combination of measurements from classical ground- based observations (for luminosity, temperature, and chemical composition) and seismic observations from MOST. Radial frequencies of models in either evolutionary phase can reproduce the observed frequency spectrum of epsilon Oph almost equally well. The best-fit models indicate a mass in the range of 1.85 +/- 0.05 M(circle dot) with radius of 10.55 +/- 0.15 R(circle dot). We also obtain an independent estimate of the radius of epsilon Oph with highly accurate interferometric observations in the infrared K' band, using the CHARA/FLUOR instrument. The measured limb-darkened disk angular diameter of epsilon Oph is 2.961 +/- 0.007 mas. Together with the Hipparcos parallax, this translates into a photospheric radius of R = 10.39 +/- 0.07 R(circle dot). The radius obtained from the asteroseismic analysis matches the interferometric value quite closely even though the radius was not constrained during the modelling.

AB Context. RR Lyrae stars (RRLS) belong to population II and are generally used as a tracer of the host galaxy halo.
   Aims. The surface as well as vertical distribution of RRLS in the inner Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are studied to understand whether these stars are actually formed in the halo.
   Methods. RRLS identified by the OGLE III survey are used to estimate their number density distribution. The scale-height of their distribution is estimated using extinction corrected average magnitudes of ab type stars.
   Results. The density distribution mimics the bar, confirming results in the literature. The distribution of their scale height indicates that there may be two populations, one with smaller scale-height, very similar to the red clump stars and the other, much larger. The distribution of the reddening-corrected magnitude along the minor axis shows variation, suggesting an inclination. The inclination is estimated to be i = 31.3 +/- 3 degrees.5 degrees, very similar to the inclination of the disk. Thus, the RRLS in the inner LMC mimic the bar and inclination of the disk, suggesting that a major fraction of RRLS is formed in the disk of the LMC.
   Conclusions. The results indicate that the RRLS in the inner LMC trace the disk and probably the inner halo. They do not trace the extended metal-poor halo of the LMC. We suggest that a major star formation event happened in the LMC at 10-12 Gyrs ago, resulting in the formation of most of the inner RRLS, as well as probably the globular clusters, inner halo and the disk of the LMC.

AB We investigate the energy-time lag dependence of the source NGC 4593 using XMM-Newton/EPIC pn data. We found that the time lag dependency is linear in nature with respect to the logarithm of different energy bands. We also investigate the frequency-dependent time lags and identify that at some frequency range (5 x 10(-5) Hz to 2 x 10(-4) Hz) the X-ray emission is highly coherent, mildly frequency dependent, and very strongly energy dependent. These observations can be explained in the framework of the thermal Comptonization process, and they indicate a truncated accretion disk very close to the black hole. We discuss the plausible spectral state to explain the phenomenon and conclude that the observed properties bear a close resemblance to the intermediate state or the steep power-law state, found in galactic black hole sources.

AB We present optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of supernova (SN) 2008D, associated with the luminous X-ray transient 080109, at > 300 days after the explosion (nebular phases). We also give flux measurements of emission lines from the H II region at the site of the SN, and estimates of the local metallicity. The brightness of the SN at nebular phases is consistent with the prediction of the explosion models with an ejected (56)Ni mass of 0.07 M(circle dot), which explains the light curve at early phases. The [O I] line in the nebular spectrum shows a double-peaked profile while the [Ca II] line does not. The double-peaked [O I] profile strongly indicates that SN 2008D is an aspherical explosion. The profile can be explained by a torus-like distribution of oxygen viewed from near the plane of the torus. We suggest that SN 2008D is a side-viewed, bipolar explosion with a viewing angle of > 50 degrees from the polar direction.

AB The proper interpretation of horizontal branch (HB) morphology is crucial to the understanding of the formation history of stellar populations. In the present study a multivariate analysis is used (principal component analysis) for the selection of appropriate HB morphology parameter, which, in our case, is the logarithm of effective temperature extent of the HB (log T-eff HB). Then this parameter is expressed in terms of the most significant observed independent parameters of Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) separately for coherent groups, obtained in a previous work, through a stepwise multiple regression technique. It is found that, metallicity ([Fe/H]), central surface brightness (mu(nu)), and core radius (r(c)) are the significant parameters to explain most of the variations in HB morphology (multiple R-2 similar to 0.86) for GGC elonging to the bulge/ disk while metallicity ([Fe/H]) and absolute magnitude (M-nu) are responsible for GGC belonging to the inner halo (multiple R-2 similar to 0.52). The robustness is tested by taking 1000 bootstrap samples. A cluster analysis is performed for the red giant branch (RGB) stars of the GGC belonging to Galactic inner halo (Cluster 2). A multi-episodic star formation is preferred for RGB stars of GGC belonging to this group. It supports the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) model in three episodes instead of two as suggested by Carretta et al. for halo GGC while AGB model is suggested to be revisited for bulge/disk GGC.

AB Pierre Auger experiment has detected at least a couple of cosmic ray events above energy 60 EeV from the direction of the radio-galaxy Centaurus A. Assuming those events are from Centaurus A, we have calculated the numbers of neutral cosmic ray events from this source for small values of the degree of violation in Lorentz invariance. Our results show that a comparison of our calculated numbers of events with the observed number of events at EeV energy from the direction of the source can probe extremely low value of the degree of this violation.

AB The late-time growth of large scale structures is imprinted in the CMBR anisotropy through the Integrated Sachs Wolfe (ISW) effect. This is perceived to be a very important observational probe of dark energy. Future observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from the cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution hold the potential of probing the large scale structure over a large redshift range. We have investigated the possibility of detecting the ISW through cross-correlations between the CMBR anisotropies and redshifted 21-cm observations. Assuming that the HI traces the dark matter, we find that the ISW-HI cross-correlation angular power spectrum at an angular multipole l is proportional to the dark matter power spectrum evaluated at the comoving wave number l/r, where r is the comoving distance to the redshift from which the HI signal originated. The amplitude of the cross-correlation signal depends on parameters related to the HI distribution and the growth of cosmological perturbations. However, the cross-correlation is extremely weak as compared to the CMBR anisotropies and the predicted HI signal. Even in an ideal situation, the cross-correlation signal is smaller than the cosmic variance and a statistically significant detection is not very likely.

AB We present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, H i 21 cm observations of SBS 0335-052E and SBS 0335-052W, a close pair of dwarf galaxies, which are further unusual in being the most metal-poor star-forming galaxies known. We present images at several angular resolutions, ranging from similar to 40 to 4 arcsec. These images show that SBS 0335-052 is a strongly interacting system, with a faint diffuse H i bridge seen at low resolution, and elongated tails seen at the higher resolutions. The overall morphology suggests that the pair represents a major (as both galaxies have similar H i masses) merger of extremely gas-rich galaxies, which is currently past the first close encounter. The low-resolution velocity field is dominated by the velocity difference between the two galaxies and the velocity gradient along the tidal features. However, for SBS 0335-052W at least, at high angular resolution, one sees a central velocity field that could be associated with the spin of the original undisturbed disc. The two galaxies have very similar H i masses, but very different optical properties and current star formation rates. A possible reason for this is the differing amounts of tidally induced star formation, because of the different spin orientations of these interacting galaxies. The highest angular resolution H i images show that the ionized superbubble, identified by Thuan, Izotov & Lipovetsky, in the Hubble Space Telescope images of SBS 0335-052E, is extended along one of the diffuse tidal features, and that there is a high-density H i clump at the other end of the superbubble. The star formation in SBS 0335-052E occurs mainly in a group of superstar clusters (SSCs) with a clear age gradient; the age decreases as one approaches the dense H i clump. We suggest that this propagating star formation is driven by the superbubble expanding into a medium with a tidally produced density gradient. The high pressures associated with the compressed material would also naturally explain why current star formation is mainly concentrated in SSCs.

AB The epoch of reionization and formation of first stars are interlinked topics that are of considerable interest. We use a simplified approach for studying the formation of stars in collapsed haloes and the resulting ionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We consider a set of Lambda cold dark matter models allowed by observations of cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization anisotropies for this study. We constrain parameters related to star formation with the help of observations. We constrain subsets of these parameters independently by using the observed metallicity of the IGM at z similar to 5 and the requirement that the Thomson scattering optical depth due to an ionized IGM as determined for the model from CMB observations be reproduced. We consider a range of initial metallicities for star-forming gas, and some variations of the initial mass function (IMF) of stars. We find that a 'normal' IMF may satisfy these two constraints with a raised efficiency of star formation as compared to that seen in the local universe. Observations require a significant fraction of metals to escape from haloes to the IGM. We can also place constraints on the ratio of escape fraction for metals and ionizing photons, and find that this ratio is of order unity for most models. This highlights the importance of using the constraints arising from enrichment of the IGM. Ultrahigh mass stars or active galactic nuclei may not simplify models of reionization in that these may produce more ionizing photons but these do not contribute to the production of metals and hence help in reducing only the escape fraction for ionizing photons. However, suppression of very low mass stars is helpful in that it increases the production of metals as well as ionizing photons, and hence leads to a reduction in both escape fractions. Such a change is also warranted by observations of metal poor halo stars in the Galaxy. We also discuss correlations in parameters like the efficiency of star formation and the two escape fractions with cosmological parameters.

AB This paper reports on an all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves from sources such as deformed isolated rapidly spinning neutron stars. The analysis uses 840 hours of data from 66 days of the fifth LIGO science run (S5). The data were searched for quasimonochromatic waves with frequencies f in the range from 50 to 1500 Hz, with a linear frequency drift f center dot (measured at the solar system barycenter) in the range -f/tau < f center dot < 0.1f/tau, for a minimum spin-down age tau of 1000 years for signals below 400 Hz and 8000 years above 400 Hz. The main computational work of the search was distributed over approximately 100 000 computers volunteered by the general public. This large computing power allowed the use of a relatively long coherent integration time of 30 hours while searching a large parameter space. This search extends Einstein@Home's previous search in LIGO S4 data to about 3 times better sensitivity. No statistically significant signals were found. In the 125-225 Hz band, more than 90% of sources with dimensionless gravitational-wave strain tensor amplitude greater than 3x10(-24) would have been detected.

ID CONSTRAINING POPULATION; SYNTHESIS MODELS; CATALOG; EVENTS; FORMS; RATES
AB We report on a search for gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries, of total mass between 2 and 35M(circle dot), using LIGO observations between November 14, 2006 and May 18, 2007. No gravitational-wave signals were detected. We report upper limits on the rate of compact binary coalescence as a function of total mass. The LIGO cumulative 90%-confidence rate upper limits of the binary coalescence of neutron stars, black holes and black hole-neutron star systems are 1.4x10(-2), 7.3x10(-4) and 3.6x10(-3) yr(-1) L-10(-1), respectively, where L-10 is 10(10) times the blue solar luminosity.

AB We demonstrate that Majorana neutrinos can form Cooper pairs due to long-range attractive forces and show BCS superfluidity in a class of mass varying neutrino dark energy models. We describe the condensates for Majorana neutrinos and estimate the value of the gap, critical temperature, and Pippard coherence length for a simple neutrino dark energy model. In the strong coupling regime bosonic degree of freedom can become important, and Bose-Einstein condensate may govern the dynamics for the mass varying neutrino models. Formation of the condensates can significantly alter the instability scenario in the mass varying neutrino models.

ID ZERO-POINT LENGTH; DENSITY PERTURBATIONS; HYPOTHESIS; INFLATION; GRAVITY
AB The hypothesis of path integral duality provides a prescription to evaluate the propagator of a free, quantum scalar field in a given classical background, taking into account the existence of a fundamental length, say, the Planck length L(P) in a locally Lorentz invariant manner. We use this prescription to evaluate the duality modified propagators in spacetimes with constant curvature (exactly in the case of one spacetime, and in the Gaussian approximation for another two), and show that (i) the modified propagators are ultraviolet finite, (ii) the modifications are nonperturbative in L(P), and (iii) L(P) seems to behave like a "zero point length" of spacetime intervals such that <<sigma(2)(x,x('))>>=[sigma(2)(x,x('))+O(1)L(P)(2)], where sigma(x,x(')) is the geodesic distance between the two spacetime points x and x('), and the angular brackets denote (a suitable) average over the quantum gravitational fluctuations. We briefly discuss the implications of our results.

AB If dark matter (DM) has nonzero direct or transition, electric or magnetic dipole moment then it can scatter nucleons electromagnetically in direct detection experiments. Using the results from experiments like XENON, CDMS, DAMA, and COGENT, we put bounds on the electric and magnetic dipole moments of DM. If DM consists of Dirac fermions with direct dipole moments, then DM of mass less than 10 GeV is consistent with the DAMA signal and with null results of other experiments. If on the other hand DM consists of Majorana fermions then they can have only nonzero transition moments between different mass eigenstates. We find that Majorana fermions with masses 38 less than or similar to m(chi) less than or similar to 100-200 GeV and mass splitting of the order of (150-200) keV can explain the DAMA signal and the null observations from other experiments and in addition give the observed relic density of DM by dipole-mediated annihilation. The absence of the heavier DM state in the present Universe can be explained by dipole-mediated radiative decay. This parameter space for the mass and for dipole moments is allowed by limits from L3 but may have observable signals at LHC.

TI Radiation from collapsing shells, semiclassical backreaction, and black

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID BACK-REACTION; GRAVITY; EVAPORATION; SPACETIME
AB We provide a detailed analysis of quantum field theory around a collapsing shell and discuss several conceptual issues related to the emission of radiation flux and formation of black holes. Explicit calculations are performed using a model for a collapsing shell, which turns out to be analytically solvable. We use the insights gained in this model to draw reliable conclusions regarding more realistic models. We first show that any shell of mass M, which collapses to a radius close to r=2M, will emit approximately thermal radiation for a period of time. In particular, a shell that collapses from some initial radius to a final radius 2M(1-epsilon(2))(-1) (where epsilon < 1) without forming a black hole, will emit thermal radiation during the period M less than or similar to t less than or similar to Mln(1/epsilon(2)). Later on (tMln(1/epsilon(2))), the flux from such a shell will decay to zero exponentially. We next study the effect of backreaction computed using the vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor on the collapse. We find that, in any realistic collapse scenario, the backreaction effects do not prevent the formation of the event horizon. The time at which the event horizon is formed is, of course, delayed due to the radiated flux-which decreases the mass of the shell-but this effect is not sufficient to prevent horizon formation. We also clarify several conceptual issues and provide pedagogical details of the calculations in the Appendices to the paper.

ID DARK ENERGY; ACCELERATING UNIVERSE; COSMIC ACCELERATION; LAMBDA
AB The f(R) gravity models proposed by Hu-Sawicki and Starobinsky are generic for local gravity constraints to be evaded. The large deviations from these models result in either violation of local gravity constraints or the modifications indistinguishable from cosmological constant. The curvature singularity in these models is generic but can be avoided, provided that proper fine-tuning is imposed on the evolution of scalaron in the high curvature regime. In principle, the problem can be circumvented by incorporating quadratic curvature correction in the Lagrangian, though it might be quite challenging to probe the relevant region numerically.

AB We discuss the performance characteristics of using the modification of the tree code suggested by Barnes in the context of the TreePM code. The optimization involves identifying groups of particles and using only one tree walk to compute the force for all the particles in the group. This modification has been in use in our implementation of the TreePM code for some time, and has also been used by others in codes that make use of tree structures. We present the first detailed study of the performance characteristics of this optimization. We show that the modification, if tuned properly, can speed up the TreePM code by a significant amount. We also combine this modification with the use of individual time steps and indicate how to combine these two schemes in an optimal fashion. We find that the combination is at least a factor of two faster than the modified TreePM without individual time steps. Overall performance is often faster by a larger factor because the scheme for the groups optimizes the use of cache for large simulations.

AB To investigate the geometry of the accretion disk in the source H1743-322, we have carried out a detailed X-ray temporal and spectral study using RXTE pointed observations. We have selected all data pertaining to the Steep Power Law (SPL) state during the 2003 outburst of this source. We find anti-correlated hard X-ray lags in three of the observations and the changes in the spectral and timing parameters (like the QPO frequency) confirm the idea of a truncated accretion disk in this source. Compiling data from similar observations of other sources, we find a correlation between the fractional change in the QPO frequency and the observed delay. We suggest that these observations indicate a definite size scale in the inner accretion disk (the radius of the truncated disk) and we explain the observed correlation using various disk parameters like Compton cooling time scale, viscous time scale etc..

AB Rapidly moving transient features have been detected in magnetic and Doppler images of super-active region NOAA 10486 during the X17/4B flare of 28 October 2003 and the X10/2B flare of 29 October 2003. Both these flares were extremely energetic white-light events. The transient features appeared during impulsive phases of the flares and moved with speeds ranging from 30 to 50 km s(-1). These features were located near the previously reported compact acoustic (Donea and Lindsey, Astrophys. J. 630, 1168, 2005) and seismic sources (Zharkova and Zharkov, Astrophys. J. 664, 573, 2007). We examine the origin of these features and their relationship with various aspects of the flares, viz., hard X-ray emission sources and flare kernels observed at different layers: i) photosphere (white-light continuum), ii) chromosphere (H alpha 6563 ), iii) temperature minimum region (UV 1600 ), and iv) transition region (UV 284 ).

AB The aim of this paper is to look at the magnetic helicity structure of an emerging active region and show that both emergence and flaring signatures are consistent with a same sign for magnetic helicity. We present a multiwavelength analysis of an M1.6 flare occurring in the NOAA active region 10365 on 27 May 2003, in which a large new bipole emerges in a decaying active region. The diverging flow pattern and the "tongue" shape of the magnetic field in the photosphere with elongated polarities are highly suggestive of the emergence of a twisted flux tube. The orientation of these tongues indicates the emergence of a flux tube with a right-hand twist (i.e., positive magnetic helicity). The flare signatures in the chromosphere are ribbons observed in H alpha by the MSDP spectrograph in the Meudon solar tower and in 1600 by TRACE. These ribbons have a J shape and are shifted along the inversion line. The pattern of these ribbons suggests that the flare was triggered by magnetic reconnection at coronal heights below a twisted flux tube of positive helicity, corresponding to that of the observed emergence. It is the first time that such a consistency between the signatures of the emerging flux through the photosphere and flare ribbons has been clearly identified in observations. Another type of ribbons observed during the flare at the periphery of the active region by the MSDP and SOHO/EIT is related to the existence of a null point, which is found high in the corona in a potential field extrapolation. We discuss the interpretation of these secondary brightenings in terms of the "breakout" model and in terms of plasma compression/heating within large-scale separatrices.

AB Statistical analysis of the relationship between type II radio bursts appearing in the metric (m) and decameter-to-hectometer (DH) wavelength ranges is presented. The associated X-ray flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are also reported. The sample is divided into two classes using the frequency-drift plots: Class I, representing those events where DH-type-II bursts are not continuation of m-type-II bursts and Class II, where the DH-type-II bursts are extensions of m-type-II bursts. Our study consists of three steps: i) comparison of characteristics of the Class I and II events; ii) correlation of m-type-II and DH-type-II burst characteristics with X-ray flare properties and iii) correlation of m-type-II and DH-type-II burst characteristics with CME properties. We have found no clear correlation between properties of m-type-II bursts and DH-type-II bursts. For example, there is no correlation between drift rates of m-type-II bursts and DH-type-II bursts. Similarly there is no correlation between their starting frequencies. In Class I events we found correlations between X-ray flare characteristics and properties of m-type-II bursts and there is no correlation between flare parameters and DH-type-II bursts. On the other hand, the correlation between CME parameters and m-type-II bursts is very weak, but it is good for CME parameters and DH-type-II bursts. These results indicate that Class I m-type-II bursts are related to the energy releases in flares, whereas DH-type-II bursts tend to be related to CMEs. On the contrary, for Class II events in the case of m-type-II and DH-type-II bursts we have found no clear correlation between both flare and CMEs.
